# Investigation Diary

## Goal

Investigate the context window visualization subsystem to design a color palette theming layer, and produce a detailed implementation guide for a new intern.

## Step 1: Evidence Gathering and Architecture Mapping

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Create a new ticket in 2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/ttmp/ (using `docmgr --root 2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/ttmp ...`) to add color palette theming support to the context_window part of @2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/ so that we can have more legible visualization of context window instead of just blue and different halftone. ~/Downloads/macos1_subtle_color_palettes.json I like /tmp/pi-clipboard-7a252d34-c9d4-4c4d-a7f7-ecd7f2f932b0.png signal orange, slate coral, cobalt / send, dusty magenta the most because the different colors are complementary so that we can nicely codify the diagrams. Create a detailed analysis / design / implementation guide that is for a new intern, explaining all the parts of the system needed to understand what it is, with prose paragraphs and bullet points and pseudocode and diagrams and api references and file references. It should be very clear and technical. Store in the ticket and then upload to remarkable. Import the json into the sources/ folder of the ticket"

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a docmgr ticket, do deep analysis of the context window visualization code, write an intern-ready design doc with full prose explanations and pseudocode, store everything in the ticket, and upload to reMarkable.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants a comprehensive, self-contained design document that a new team member could pick up and implement without needing to ask questions. The document should explain what context windows are, how the visualization system works, and exactly what code to change — with concrete color values from the preferred palettes.

### What I did

- Read every source file in the context window visualization subsystem:
  - `src/context/types.ts` — 15 `ContextPartKind` values, 3 diagram styles
  - `src/context/kinds.ts` — Visual spec system with 3 registries (pattern/tone/outline)
  - `src/context/fixtures.ts` — Example snapshot data (4 snapshots)
  - `src/components/molecules/ContextStripDiagram/` — Horizontal strip view
  - `src/components/molecules/ContextStackDiagram/` — Vertical layer view
  - `src/components/molecules/ContextBudgetBar/` — Budget bar with headroom
  - `src/components/molecules/ContextTreemap/` — Area-proportional treemap
  - `src/components/molecules/ContextLegend/` — Kind swatch legend
  - `src/components/atoms/ContextKindSwatch/` — Individual swatch atom
  - `src/components/organisms/ContextDiagramPanel/` — View orchestrator
  - `src/theme.css` — CSS custom properties
  - All 4 CSS modules — Pattern-based `.kind_*` rules
- Read the `macos1_subtle_color_palettes.json` (16 palettes, 225 lines)
- Analyzed the screenshot showing the palette sheet
- Identified the 3-tier color mapping strategy (accent / tint / neutral)
- Pre-computed tint values for all 4 preferred palettes

### Why

The user needs to understand every layer of the system to design a theming approach that fits cleanly into the existing architecture. The `kinds.ts` visual spec system already has a mode-switching mechanism (`pattern` / `tone` / `outline`), making `'color'` a natural fourth mode.

### What worked

- The existing `getContextKindSpec(kind, mode)` function is perfectly designed for extension — just add a new `colorOverrides` registry and a `mode === 'color'` branch.
- The `data-mode` attribute pattern already on all diagram roots means CSS can use attribute selectors for mode-specific rules.
- CSS custom properties enable palette switching without React changes.

### What didn't work

- Initially tried to use inline styles for fills, but realized this breaks palette switching (would need React re-renders). CSS custom properties are the right approach.
- The pre-computed hex values for tints are tedious to calculate by hand. Used `color-mix()` mental model and verified with hex arithmetic.

### What I learned

- The system has exactly 4 diagram molecules, 1 atom, 1 organism, and 1 spec registry — a small, well-scoped surface area.
- The 15 `ContextPartKind` values can be reduced to 3 visual tiers based on semantic importance.
- The Dusty Magenta / Blue palette naturally maps to the human-vs-machine duality in context windows.

### What was tricky to build

- **Color-to-kind mapping:** 15 kinds × 2-3 accent colors means most kinds get tints, not pure accents. The three-tier system (accent / tint / neutral) was the key insight that makes this work.
- **Tint computation:** Getting the right opacity level for each tier so that kinds are distinguishable but not garish. 30% for retrieval, 20% for tool, 25% for result — these differences matter visually.
- **Colored halftone vs flat fills:** Initially designed color mode as flat solid fills (replacing patterns entirely). User requested keeping the halftone patterns and coloring the pattern lines instead. This required splitting the CSS tokens into `--rag-context-line-<kind>` (pattern marks) and `--rag-context-fill-<kind>` (background behind pattern), and re-creating each CSS pattern with the colored tokens.
- **Provider pattern for CSS vars:** How to switch palettes without React re-renders. Solution: `ContextPaletteProvider` sets CSS custom properties as inline `style` on a wrapper `<div>`. Descendants consume via `var()`. No React context needed — pure CSS cascade.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- The WCAG contrast ratios for label-on-fill in color mode — verify with an automated checker.
- The `color-mix()` fallback strategy — confirm that all target browsers support it or that the pre-computed values work as a fallback.

### What should be done in the future

- Phase 2: Palette selector component
- Phase 3: Dark mode palettes
- Chromatic snapshot tests for color mode

### Code review instructions

- Start with `design-doc/01-color-palette-theming-design-implementation-guide.md`
- Verify the three-tier mapping makes sense for the user's mental model
- Check the pre-computed hex values in the palette swatch tables
- Walk through the pseudocode in Steps 1–6 and verify it matches the existing code patterns

### Technical details

- Total files to modify: 9 (types, kinds, theme, 4 CSS modules, swatch CSS, panel TSX)
- Total estimated lines: ~430
- No new dependencies needed
- No changes to data flow, widget registry, or layout components

## Step 2: Reframe Around Configurable Legends and Style Sets

The second design pass changed the core abstraction. Instead of making the existing hardcoded `ContextPartKind` list prettier, the revised design treats kinds as only a default preset and introduces a caller-defined `ContextStyleSet` for custom legend labels, flexible palette size, and per-label visual styles.

This was prompted by the requirement that a caller should be able to say: "I have three labels for this context diagram, here is the thing to render, and here is what style each label has." That requirement means the legend, segment style, and data semantics must be separated.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Ok, so we actually also want to make the legend labels and even the size of the palette flexible and configurable. So basically we'd say \" i have 3 labels for this context diagram, and here's the thing to render, and here's what style each has\", which I think has some pretty interesting impact on the design. 

So far, this has been done by your little brother, so I want you to take a critical look at it, especially in light of the above instructions to redo how legends for context window widgets work, and then make a new reviewed updated version (in a separate document) that points out what is good, what is problematic, what should be changed, how it should be changed, giving proper explanations so that they can do better next time. Upload to remarkable as well, write in a similar style."

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a separate critical review document that preserves the good parts of the previous design but revises the architecture around caller-configurable legend labels, arbitrary palette size, and per-label styles.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the implementation guide to teach a better abstraction: data segments should refer to caller-defined style keys, legends should not be hardcoded to `ContextPartKind`, and Storybook should prove that the same layout can render with custom labels and style sets.

### What I did

- Inspected the Widget IR contract in `src/widgets/ir.ts`.
- Confirmed that `ContextLegendWidgetProps`, `ContextDiagramPanelWidgetProps`, and individual diagram widget props are currently tied to `ContextPartKind` and `ContextDiagramStyle`.
- Added `design-doc/02-reviewed-design-configurable-legends-and-style-palettes.md`.
- Critiqued the previous design constructively:
  - good: colored halftone, CSS variables, Storybook showcase direction;
  - problematic: `kind` does too much, legends derive from hardcoded enums, CSS is hardcoded as `.kind_*`, palette size is assumed to match built-in vocabulary.
- Proposed `styleKey`, `ContextVisualStyle`, `ContextLegendItemSpec`, and `ContextStyleSet`.
- Proposed replacing `.kind_*` CSS with generic `.pattern_*` classes and per-segment CSS variables.
- Proposed Widget IR changes so server-sent widgets can carry arbitrary label/style definitions.

### Why

The new requirement invalidates a purely hardcoded-kind color palette design. A custom three-label diagram should not require editing global TypeScript unions, CSS classes, or visual registries. The component library should provide a generic visual grammar and treat built-in context kinds as one preset.

### What worked

- The existing Widget IR is already JSON-like, so `ContextStyleSet` can be made JSON-compatible and carried through widget props.
- The diagram components already centralize rendering around snapshot parts, so adding `styleKey` resolution is conceptually straightforward.
- The existing pattern CSS can be preserved if rewritten as generic `.pattern_*` renderers.

### What didn't work

- The previous `ContextPaletteProvider` idea alone does not solve the legend problem. It can scope theme tokens, but it cannot express "these are my three legend labels and styles" unless paired with a per-diagram `styleSet`.

### What I learned

- `ContextPartKind` is currently a semantic type, visual style key, legend key, and CSS class suffix all at once.
- The better API is `snapshot.parts[].styleKey` plus `styleSet.styles[styleKey]` and `styleSet.legend`.
- Storybook should include a custom diagram that uses no built-in `kind` fields at all; that is the strongest test of the new design.

### What was tricky to build

- Distinguishing global theme switching from per-diagram style configuration. A provider helps global CSS tokens cascade, but the required product behavior is local: each diagram can define its own labels and style count.
- Keeping backward compatibility without preserving the bad abstraction as the primary API. The solution is to keep `ContextPartKind` as a built-in style preset and a legacy path, while making `items + styles` the primary legend API.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- The exact naming of `styleKey` vs `legendKey` vs `categoryId`. `styleKey` is implementation-friendly, but `legendKey` might better express caller intent.
- Whether `ContextStyleSet.legend.label` should be plain string or `RenderableValue` in Widget IR. The doc recommends Widget IR support for richer labels, but React component props can start with string.

### What should be done in the future

- Implement the new generic style layer before adding more palette presets.
- Add Storybook tests for a three-label diagram with no `kind` fields.
- Add Widget IR examples with `styleSet` embedded in JSON.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `design-doc/02-reviewed-design-configurable-legends-and-style-palettes.md`.
- Review `src/widgets/ir.ts` first, especially the context diagram widget prop interfaces.
- Then review `ContextLegend.tsx`, `ContextKindSwatch.tsx`, and the four diagram molecules to plan the migration away from `.kind_*` CSS.

### Technical details

- New primary contract: `ContextStyleSet`.
- New part lookup field: `ContextWindowPart.styleKey`.
- New rendering primitive: generic `.pattern_*` CSS classes plus `--ctx-fill`, `--ctx-line`, `--ctx-stroke`, and `--ctx-label` variables.
- Legacy path: `ContextPartKind` maps into a built-in default `ContextStyleSet`.

## Step 3: Hard-Cutover Update — No Backwards Compatibility

This update removes the migration-wrapper framing from the reviewed design. The implementation should not preserve `ContextPartKind`, `ContextKindSwatch`, `legendKinds`, `legendMode`, `.kind_*` CSS, or fallback-to-kind behavior. The only current consumers are `2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/` and `ClubMedMeetup/`, so both should be updated to the new `styleKey` + `ContextStyleSet` API in the same branch.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "we don't need backwards compatibility, we only have 2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/ and ClubMedMeetup/ using the system for now, and those can be updated. So no backwards wrappers or so, just hardcutover. Update the doc and create detailed tasks in the ticket."

**Assistant interpretation:** Revise the reviewed design so it explicitly requires a hard cutover instead of preserving legacy wrappers or migration paths, and replace the ticket task list with detailed implementation tasks.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants a cleaner implementation with one API, not a dual-mode compatibility layer. They want the docs and tasks to prevent the implementer from adding shims that preserve the wrong abstraction.

### What I did

- Updated `design-doc/02-reviewed-design-configurable-legends-and-style-palettes.md` to add a hard-cutover directive.
- Replaced optional/compatibility language with required `styleKey: string` and required `styleSet: ContextStyleSet`.
- Removed recommendations to preserve `ContextKindSwatch`, `legendKinds`, `legendMode`, diagram `mode`, `.kind_*` CSS, and fallback-to-old-kind resolution.
- Replaced `tasks.md` with a detailed implementation checklist covering architecture, style model, CSS, diagram components, legend/swatch, Widget IR, Storybook, and validation.

### Why

Maintaining compatibility would keep the wrong abstraction alive. Since the only consumers are known and can be updated, the cleanest implementation is a single hard-cutover to caller-defined style sets.

### What worked

- The reviewed design already had the right destination (`styleKey` + `ContextStyleSet`); the update mainly removed transition scaffolding.
- The task list now directly encodes forbidden old APIs and validation searches.

### What didn't work

- The previous reviewed document still contained several legacy/migration phrases (`kind` fallback, `ContextKindSwatch` wrapper, `legendKinds`, and `.kind_*` migration layer). Those had to be removed to avoid implementer confusion.

### What I learned

- The acceptance criteria need to state negative requirements explicitly: no wrappers, no legacy props, no `.kind_*` selectors, no fallback resolution.

### What was tricky to build

- Keeping `fallbackStyle` language without implying backwards compatibility. The doc now frames it as production resilience only, not as a way to silently support old `kind` data.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether any non-diagram components still need `ContextPartKind` for annotations/badges. If yes, either cut those over too or separate their domain model from diagram styling explicitly.

### What should be done in the future

- During implementation, run a repo-wide search for `ContextPartKind`, `ContextKindSwatch`, `legendKinds`, `legendMode`, `.kind_`, and `kind:` before review.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `tasks.md`; it is now the authoritative implementation checklist.
- Then review `design-doc/02-reviewed-design-configurable-legends-and-style-palettes.md`, especially the hard-cutover directive and acceptance criteria.

### Technical details

- Updated document: `design-doc/02-reviewed-design-configurable-legends-and-style-palettes.md`
- Updated task list: `tasks.md`

## Step 4: Frontend Core StyleSet Cutover

This implementation slice replaced the frontend context diagram rendering path from hardcoded `kind` classes to required `styleKey` plus `ContextStyleSet`. It also replaced `ContextKindSwatch` with `ContextStyleSwatch` and updated the molecule/organism Storybook stories so reviewers can change styles live.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Now implement these tasks one by one, commit at appropriate intervals, keep a frequent detailed diary as you work, add lots of testing stories in the storybook and the IR Widget transformer, and carry things all the way through to the goja DSL as well."

**Assistant interpretation:** Begin the implementation, commit in focused chunks, and keep a detailed diary. Start with the frontend hard-cutover before moving to Widget IR and Goja DSL.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the design turned into working code across React components, Storybook, Widget IR, and Goja DSL, with reviewable commits and progress notes.

**Commit (code):** pending — frontend core cutover

### What I did

- Rewrote `src/context/types.ts` to remove `ContextPartKind` from context diagram parts and require `styleKey`.
- Added `src/context/styles.ts` with `ContextVisualStyle`, `ContextStyleSet`, palette definitions, style resolution, CSS var conversion, and palette-derived style-set helpers.
- Converted fixtures in `src/context/fixtures.ts` from `kind` to `styleKey` and exported default/preferred style sets.
- Deleted `ContextKindSwatch` and created `ContextStyleSwatch`.
- Replaced the four diagram molecule renderers to require `styleSet`, resolve each part by `styleKey`, and render generic pattern classes with CSS variables.
- Replaced `.kind_*` CSS with `.pattern_*` CSS in strip, stack, budget, treemap, and swatch styles.
- Replaced `ContextLegend` with required `items + styles` props.
- Updated molecule Storybook stories, including live style switchers for `ContextStripDiagram` and `ContextDiagramPanel`.
- Updated `CourseSlidePanel`, `FigureBlock` stories, `SlideShell` stories, and `CourseStudioShell` stories to pass style sets.
- Ran `pnpm typecheck`; initial run found expected old API references; after fixes, typecheck passes.

### Why

This is the foundation needed before Widget IR and Goja DSL can be updated. The React components must have a stable hard-cutover API first; otherwise the downstream DSL work would target a moving contract.

### What worked

- The generic pattern CSS approach worked well: all diagrams now use the same style variables (`--ctx-fill`, `--ctx-line`, `--ctx-stroke`, `--ctx-label`) and pattern class names.
- TypeScript caught many old references immediately, especially Storybook stories and annotation components.
- The live Storybook style switcher is a useful acceptance test because the same snapshot can be rendered under multiple style sets without changing data.

### What didn't work

- A simple mechanical `kind` → `styleKey` replacement was not enough. Components such as `AnnotationBadge`, `AnnotationNoteCard`, `CourseSlidePanel`, and `FigureBlock` needed explicit style-set or visual-style handling.
- Two story files referenced `contextDefaultStyleSet` without importing it after automated replacements; typecheck caught this.

### What I learned

- The hard-cutover removes a lot of branching: after `ContextStyleSet` is required, components no longer need `mode`, `legendMode`, `legendKinds`, or kind lookups.
- Molecule stories are important because they catch lower-level missing props before organism stories do.

### What was tricky to build

- Keeping annotation UI compiling without reintroducing `ContextPartKind`. I updated it to use `ContextVisualStyle` directly, with transcript note cards resolving `annotation.styleKey` through a style set.
- Making Storybook interactive without adding a production palette selector. The stories use local `useState` buttons to switch style sets, which proves the styling model without adding app-level UI.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether annotation/transcript panels should require a `styleSet` prop instead of using `contextDefaultStyleSet` as a temporary default.
- Whether the default style-set helper should live in `fixtures.ts` or a dedicated preset file.

### What should be done in the future

- Update Widget IR stories and Goja DSL helpers to emit required `styleSet`.
- Run `build-storybook` after Widget IR stories are migrated.
- Search for remaining `kind`, `ContextKindSwatch`, `legendKinds`, `legendMode`, and `.kind_` references.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `src/context/types.ts` and `src/context/styles.ts`.
- Then review `ContextStyleSwatch`, `ContextLegend`, and one diagram molecule (strip) before reviewing the other diagrams.
- Validate with `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`.

### Technical details

- Validation run: `pnpm typecheck` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`.
- Final result: typecheck passed after story/component fixes.

## Step 5: Widget IR and Goja DSL StyleSet Cutover

This implementation slice carried the hard-cutover contract through Widget IR stories, the Go widget DSL module, the xgoja provider documentation, and schema metadata. The JavaScript-facing `context_window.dsl` module now has helpers for building visual styles, legend items, style sets, context parts, snapshots, and palette-derived style sets.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "create it, then continue working"

**Assistant interpretation:** Create the Goja DSL design note, update tasks, then continue implementing the cutover through the DSL layer.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the DSL implementation to follow a documented contract and keep progressing beyond frontend-only changes.

**Commit (code):** pending — Widget IR and Goja DSL cutover

### What I did

- Created `design-doc/03-goja-dsl-styleset-cutover.md` defining the Goja DSL contract.
- Updated `tasks.md` with a Goja DSL hard-cutover checklist and marked completed frontend/DSL tasks.
- Updated `WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx` so all context diagram IR examples include `styleSet` and use `styleKey` parts.
- Updated `WidgetRenderer.foundation-atoms.stories.tsx`, `WidgetRenderer.layout-recipes.stories.tsx`, and `WidgetRenderer.course-handout.stories.tsx` to use `ContextStyleSwatch` and `AnnotationBadge.visualStyle`.
- Removed `ContextKindSwatch` from the Go widget schema component list and replaced it with `ContextStyleSwatch`.
- Updated `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go`:
  - removed `contextKindSwatch`,
  - added `contextStyleSwatch`,
  - added `visualStyle`, `legendItem`, `styleSet`, `contextPart`, `contextSnapshot`, and `paletteStyleSet`,
  - updated `recipes.contextDiagram` to require `styleSet` or `palette + entries`.
- Updated `pkg/widgetdsl/module_test.go` for style-set helpers, JSON shape, and missing-styleSet errors.
- Updated xgoja provider docs to show `styleKey` + `styleSet` instead of `kind`.

### Why

The React hard cutover is only useful if server/Goja-generated IR can express the same contract. The DSL must make the correct API easy and must fail when callers omit required styling information.

### What worked

- The DSL's generic component factory already copies props through, so most component helper behavior needed no special-case code.
- Adding focused JSON-constructor helpers in `context_window.dsl` kept the Go implementation compact.
- The forbidden API search found only documentation references after the code cutover, which were straightforward to update.

### What didn't work

- The existing `recipes.contextDiagram` silently constructed a panel without style information. That had to become a deliberate error to enforce the new contract.

### What I learned

- The Goja DSL layer is mostly a JSON builder; this style-set cutover fits its existing helper pattern well.
- Tests at the DSL level are valuable because they assert the emitted JSON shape, not just React type correctness.

### What was tricky to build

- Ensuring the Go DSL can construct useful palette-derived style sets without pulling in a heavy color library. I used CSS `color-mix(...)` strings, which are JSON-compatible and resolved by the browser.
- Keeping the missing-styleSet behavior strict while still allowing a convenience path via `palette + entries`.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether `paletteStyleSet` should support all 16 imported JSON palettes or only the four preferred palettes for now.
- Whether `contextSnapshot` should validate that every part styleKey exists in the styleSet. Currently that validation is left to React/style resolution and recipe requirements.

### What should be done in the future

- Add a full app/package build after committing this slice.
- Audit `ClubMedMeetup/` and any backend API examples for runtime pages that still emit old context diagram props.

### Code review instructions

- Review `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go` helper exports and `contextDiagramRecipe` first.
- Then review `pkg/widgetdsl/module_test.go` to understand the expected JS-facing API.
- Validate with `go test ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/widgetschema ./internal/widgetmanifest -count=1`, `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`, and `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook`.

### Technical details

Validation passed:

- `pnpm typecheck` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`
- `go test ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/widgetschema ./internal/widgetmanifest -count=1`
- `pnpm build-storybook` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`
- forbidden API search for `ContextKindSwatch`, `ContextPartKind`, `legendKinds`, `legendMode`, `.kind_`, and context-diagram `kind:` data

## Step 6: ClubMed Consumer Cutover and Embedded SPA Regeneration

This step updated the active ClubMed meetup consumer so it no longer sends old context-window `kind` part data into the Widget IR renderer. The course slide Markdown, slide loader, session-derived model, LiteLLM live model, and page composition now use `styleKey` parts plus an explicit `ContextStyleSet` when rendering context diagrams.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "continue"

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue the hard cutover beyond the already committed frontend and Goja DSL work, especially remaining consumer audits and validation.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the implementation finished end-to-end, including external consumers and generated/bundled assets.

**Commit (code):** pending — ClubMed consumer cutover

### What I did

- Audited `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz` active code for context-window diagram usage.
- Updated Markdown slide context-window blocks in `course/slides/01-window-budget.md` and `course/slides/02-tool-results.md` from `kind` to `styleKey`.
- Updated `lib/slide-loader.js` so Markdown-authored context-window parts normalize only `styleKey`.
- Updated `lib/course-session-data.js` so generated session snapshots use `styleKey` for context-window parts and selection logic.
- Updated `lib/litellm-live-service.js` so live LiteLLM context snapshots use `styleKey` for context-window parts and selection logic.
- Updated `lib/course-pages.js` to build a palette-derived `styleSet` with `contextWindow.paletteStyleSet(...)` and pass it to `CourseSlidePanel` and `ContextDiagramPanel` calls.
- Rebuilt the local RAG widget package, pointed the ClubMed webapp at the built local package, rebuilt/synced the SPA, regenerated the xgoja package embed, and removed stale embedded asset hashes.
- Marked the remaining audit/consumer tasks complete after validation.

### Why

The hard cutover would still fail in the meetup app if server-generated Widget IR kept emitting old part `kind` fields or omitted required `styleSet` props. The embedded SPA also had to be regenerated because the checked-in bundle still contained the previous renderer implementation.

### What worked

- `pnpm typecheck` passed in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/webapp` after switching to the rebuilt local RAG package.
- `make build` passed in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz`, proving the xgoja package still builds with the regenerated embed.
- Active-code searches no longer found old context-window diagram API names in current source/assets.

### What didn't work

- `./scripts/sync-widget-spa.sh` initially failed with `ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE` because `webapp/package.json` was changed before refreshing `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Pointing the webapp dependency at the local package source initially failed Vite resolution for `@go-go-golems/rag-evaluation-site/app` because package exports refer to built files. The fix was to run the RAG package build and point the file dependency at `packages/rag-evaluation-site/dist`.

### What I learned

- ClubMed has two deployable SPA copies: `assets/public` for the JS runtime and `internal/xgojaruntime/xgoja_embed/...` for the generated xgoja package. Both must be regenerated/cleaned together.
- xgoja generation does not automatically remove stale hashed assets in the embed directory, so old hashes must be deleted explicitly after regeneration.

### What was tricky to build

- Distinguishing context-window part `kind` from unrelated annotation/message/action `kind` fields. I only changed context-window parts to `styleKey`; annotation DTOs still use `kind` because that is a separate contract.
- Avoiding accidental historical-doc churn: many old `ttmp/` evidence files still mention `ContextKindSwatch` and `ContextPartKind`, but they are not active consumers.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- The ClubMed webapp now depends on a sibling built `dist` package for local development. Review whether that should remain as a file dependency or be replaced by a published package bump later.
- The style labels chosen for ClubMed are a pragmatic default palette; a designer may want Meetup-specific labels/colors.

### What should be done in the future

- Run an end-to-end smoke request against the ClubMed server to inspect returned Widget IR JSON for `styleSet` and `styleKey` after committing.
- Consider adding a lightweight test that rejects context-window snapshot parts containing `kind`.

### Code review instructions

- In ClubMed, start with `minitrace-viz/lib/course-pages.js`, then review the three snapshot producers: `slide-loader.js`, `course-session-data.js`, and `litellm-live-service.js`.
- Confirm generated assets are expected by comparing old/new filenames in `assets/public` and `internal/xgojaruntime/xgoja_embed/...`.
- Validate with `pnpm typecheck` in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/webapp` and `make build` in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz`.

### Technical details

Validation passed:

- `pnpm typecheck` in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/webapp`
- `make build` in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz`
- active-code old API search excluding historical `ttmp/`, `node_modules`, and build output

## Step 7: First Storybook Palette Control for ContextDiagramPanel

This step made palette switching directly tryable from Storybook controls for the primary `ContextDiagramPanel` organism. Before this, palette switching existed only as in-canvas buttons on a custom story, which made it harder to exercise through the standard Storybook Controls panel and harder to compare with normal Storybook workflows.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "can we use controls in storybook to switch palette? or how can I try it?"

**Assistant interpretation:** Add a Storybook Controls dropdown for palette switching and explain where to try it in Storybook.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants palette theming to be discoverable through standard Storybook controls, not only via custom in-canvas UI.

**Commit (code):** 080dbbd2526ff83ae9e559a1d4032a1e820804d0 — "Storybook: add context palette controls"

### What I did

- Inspected `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/ContextDiagramPanel/ContextDiagramPanel.stories.tsx`.
- Confirmed `InteractiveStyleSwitcher` already existed but used local React state and in-canvas buttons.
- Added a `PaletteControls` story for `ContextDiagramPanel` with a Storybook `select` control.
- Added palette options for:
  - `Dusty Magenta / Blue`,
  - `Signal Orange / Cyan`,
  - `Slate / Coral`,
  - `Cobalt / Sand`.
- Added controls for `initialView`, `showLegend`, and `showPartDetails`.
- Kept `snapshot`, `selectedPartId`, and `views` non-editable where editing them via Controls would be noisy or structurally unsafe.

### Why

Storybook users expect visual variants to be controlled through the Controls panel. The hard-cutover introduced explicit `ContextStyleSet` props, so Storybook needed an ergonomic way to swap those style sets without editing code or relying on custom story buttons.

### What worked

- The existing style-set fixtures made the control mapping simple.
- TypeScript accepted `PaletteControlsArgs = Omit<ContextDiagramPanelProps, 'styleSet'> & { palette: PaletteName }` for a standalone controls story.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed after the story was added.

### What didn't work

- At this stage, only one dedicated `PaletteControls` story was added. Existing stories such as `InteractiveViews` and `StartingViews` still rendered fixed `contextDefaultStyleSet` values.
- The implementation did not yet solve the user's later concern that every relevant story should expose palette controls directly.

### What I learned

- A separate controls story is a useful first test, but it is not enough when the user wants to browse existing stories and switch palettes there.
- Storybook story args can carry a palette key and map it to a full `ContextStyleSet` at render time.

### What was tricky to build

- The actual React component requires `styleSet`; Storybook controls should expose a simple string dropdown rather than the full nested style-set object.
- The safe pattern is to hide the raw `styleSet` prop from controls and introduce a story-only `palette` arg.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether `initialView` should stay as a story control even though the panel has its own in-component view buttons.
- Whether `views` should be exposed in controls later via a multiselect-like control, or kept fixed to avoid invalid combinations.

### What should be done in the future

- Add the same palette control to context molecule stories and Widget IR stories.
- Promote `palette` controls onto the existing stories rather than only adding dedicated `PaletteControls` variants.

### Code review instructions

- Start at `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/ContextDiagramPanel/ContextDiagramPanel.stories.tsx`.
- Review the `PaletteControlsArgs` type and `paletteControlStyleSets` map.
- Validate with `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`.

### Technical details

Validation passed:

- `pnpm typecheck` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`

## Step 8: Palette Controls Across Context Stories and Widget IR

This step expanded the initial single-story controls approach across the Storybook surface. It added palette controls to context atoms, molecules, organisms, layout wrappers that embed context visuals, and Widget IR stories that render context diagrams or context-toned badges/swatches.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "make it for all stories with context molecules / organisms"

**Assistant interpretation:** Add palette controls to every context-related molecule and organism Storybook story, not just `ContextDiagramPanel`.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants consistent palette exploration across the design-system surface so every context visualization can be tested under alternate palettes.

**Commit (code):** 1392962d2367b48c19fd0042bf2b342547869246 — "Storybook: add palette controls across context stories"

### What I did

- Added `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/storyPalettes.ts` as a shared Storybook helper module.
- Exported `storyPalettes.ts` from `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/index.ts`.
- Defined:
  - `ContextPaletteName`,
  - `contextPaletteStyleSets`,
  - `contextPaletteOptions`,
  - `contextStyleSetForPalette(palette)`.
- Added palette controls to context atoms:
  - `AnnotationBadge.stories.tsx`,
  - `ContextStyleSwatch.stories.tsx`.
- Added palette controls to context molecules:
  - `ContextBudgetBar.stories.tsx`,
  - `ContextLegend.stories.tsx`,
  - `ContextStackDiagram.stories.tsx`,
  - `ContextStripDiagram.stories.tsx`,
  - `ContextTreemap.stories.tsx`,
  - `FigureBlock.stories.tsx`.
- Added palette controls to context/layout/organism wrappers:
  - `ContextDiagramPanel.stories.tsx`,
  - `CourseSlidePanel.stories.tsx`,
  - `CourseStudioShell.stories.tsx`,
  - `SlideShell.stories.tsx`.
- Added palette-controlled Widget IR stories:
  - `WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx`,
  - `WidgetRenderer.foundation-atoms.stories.tsx`,
  - `WidgetRenderer.layout-recipes.stories.tsx`,
  - `WidgetRenderer.course-handout.stories.tsx`.
- Updated Widget IR course/handout stories where context visuals previously relied on implicit/default style behavior, making explicit `styleSet` props visible in the IR examples.

### Why

The style-set hard cutover affects both direct React components and server-provided Widget IR. If only direct component stories can switch palettes, the Widget IR path can still regress unnoticed. The user explicitly called out molecules/organisms and then the IR renderer as part of the same UX requirement.

### What worked

- A shared palette helper avoided duplicating the same `Record<PaletteName, ContextStyleSet>` in every story file.
- The same story-only `palette` arg pattern worked for direct React stories and Widget IR stories.
- Storybook build remained successful after broadening controls coverage.

### What didn't work

- The first implementation mostly added separate `PaletteControls` stories, leaving many existing/full stories with fixed palettes.
- Some Widget IR stories contained context-style props only indirectly through badges or nested slide visuals; these required additional helper functions to rebuild a `WidgetNode` tree from the selected palette.

### What I learned

- For Widget IR, palette switching must rebuild the serialized node tree because the palette is embedded in `props.styleSet` or `props.visualStyle`.
- Storybook controls over deeply nested React nodes are much cleaner when the story exposes one small `palette` arg and regenerates the tree in `render`.

### What was tricky to build

- Distinguishing stories that use context palette data as primary subject matter from stories that only include a context badge incidentally.
- Avoiding raw `styleSet` controls, which would expose a large nested JSON object that is hard to manipulate and easy to corrupt.
- Keeping the Widget IR examples JSON-compatible while still passing full style objects as serializable props.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether all incidentally context-toned stories should keep a palette control, or whether controls should be limited to stories whose title/subject is context visualization.
- Whether `storyPalettes.ts` belongs in `src/context` long-term or should live under a Storybook-specific helpers directory.

### What should be done in the future

- Replace separate `PaletteControls` variants with full-story controls where the user wants the existing story names to support palette switching.
- Add visual regression coverage for a few palette permutations.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `src/context/storyPalettes.ts` to understand the shared helper.
- Then review one direct React story (`ContextBudgetBar.stories.tsx`) and one Widget IR story (`WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx`) to compare the two control patterns.
- Validate with `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck` and `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook`.

### Technical details

Validation passed:

- `pnpm typecheck` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`
- `pnpm build-storybook` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`

## Step 9: Promoting Palette Controls onto the Full Context Stories

This step corrected the Storybook UX from “there is a separate controls story” to “the real stories have palette controls.” The user pointed out that stories such as `Widget IR / Renderer / Context Diagrams` and `Component Library / Molecules / ContextStackDiagram` should expose palette switching directly in their existing story variants.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "can't we add the palette control for say, Widget IR / Renderer / Context Diagrams in full? for and  
 say Component Library / Molecules / ContextStackDiagram, etc..."

**Assistant interpretation:** Move the palette control into the main/full stories themselves, especially Widget IR context diagrams and context diagram molecules, rather than limiting controls to separate `PaletteControls` stories.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants normal Storybook navigation to support palette switching on the stories they are already inspecting.

**Commit (code):** f8ec7f5bfa700999f512941728594724080becd2 — "Storybook: promote palette controls to full context stories"

### What I did

- Updated `ContextBudgetBar.stories.tsx` so `BudgetStates`, `SelectedSegment`, and `SameBudgetDifferentPalettes` all respond to a `palette` control.
- Updated `ContextStackDiagram.stories.tsx` so `GroupedContextWindow`, `SelectedLayer`, and `Comparison` all respond to a `palette` control.
- Updated `ContextStripDiagram.stories.tsx` so `DenseSegments`, `SelectedSegment`, `LimitComparison`, and `InteractiveStyleSwitcher` all respond to a `palette` control.
- Updated `ContextTreemap.stories.tsx` so `ProportionalTokens`, `SelectedTile`, and `Comparison` all respond to a `palette` control.
- Updated `ContextDiagramPanel.stories.tsx` so existing stories such as `InteractiveViews`, `StartingViews`, `ContentBlocksWithPartDetails`, and `LegendDerivedFromSnapshotParts` use the selected palette.
- Rewrote `WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx` so the main Widget IR stories rebuild their `WidgetNode` trees from the selected palette:
  - `ContextDiagramGallery`,
  - `ContextDiagramPanelViews`,
  - `ContextDiagramPanelContentDetails`,
  - `ContextDiagramWithMetadataSidebar`,
  - `OverBudgetContextWindow`.

### Why

A separate `PaletteControls` story is discoverable only if the user knows to open it. Putting the control on the existing/full stories makes palette switching part of the normal inspection workflow and avoids duplicate near-identical stories.

### What worked

- After typing adjustments, `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build-storybook` passed.
- The same palette control now works on the requested `Widget IR / Renderer / Context Diagrams / ContextDiagramPanelViews` story.
- Widget IR examples proved that server-provided style sets can be swapped by rebuilding the serialized IR tree.

### What didn't work

- The first refactor attempt typed story meta as `Meta<StoryArgs>` while also keeping `component: ContextStackDiagram` / `component: WidgetRenderer`. TypeScript inferred the component prop type and rejected the story-only `palette` arg.
- Removing `component` from the typed meta was not sufficient by itself; `StoryObj<typeof meta>` still inferred `{}` in several files.
- The fix was to type story aliases directly as `StoryObj<StoryArgs>` (or `StoryObj<PaletteControlsArgs>` for `ContextDiagramPanel`) so the render function sees `palette` and other story-only args.

### What I learned

- Storybook + TypeScript is sensitive to extra story args when `component` is present in `Meta`. For story-only args that deliberately do not exist on the React component, typing stories directly against a custom args type is more reliable.
- A Storybook story can still document/render a component without setting `component` in the meta if the story requires a synthetic arg model.

### What was tricky to build

- Balancing Storybook docs/autodocs convenience against type-safe custom args. Keeping `component` gave better component metadata but broke story-only args; removing it plus direct `StoryObj<StoryArgs>` typing resolved the type errors.
- Ensuring `selectedPartId`, `showLegend`, and `showLabels` remained useful controls while hiding large object props such as `snapshot` and raw `node`.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether losing `component` metadata in these story files is acceptable for Storybook docs. If not, a custom wrapper component could be introduced solely for Storybook args.
- Whether `CustomThreeLabelWidgetIR` should keep controls disabled or expose a separate custom label-set selector.

### What should be done in the future

- Consider a small Storybook wrapper utility that standardizes the `palette` control pattern and preserves component docs where possible.
- Add a short Storybook note explaining that `palette` controls are story-only args mapped to `ContextStyleSet` props.

### Code review instructions

- Review the `StoryArgs`/`PaletteControlsArgs` types in the modified story files.
- Pay special attention to `WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx`, where `render` rebuilds Widget IR nodes from palette selection.
- Validate with `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck` and `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook`.

### Technical details

Validation passed:

- `pnpm typecheck` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`
- `pnpm build-storybook` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`

## Step 10: Varied Legend Vocabulary and Legend Size in Storybook

This step changed the Storybook examples from “same default 15-entry legend under different colors” to “different caller-defined vocabularies with smaller legend sets.” It specifically targeted the `Widget IR / Renderer / Context Diagrams / ContextDiagramPanelViews` story and the `ContextStackDiagram` molecule stories.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "be more varied in the naming and amount of legend entries in say, http://localhost:6007/?path=/story/widget-ir-renderer-context-diagrams--context-diagram-panel-views

no need to always have 15 legend members, now that we can configure them."

**Assistant interpretation:** Update the story data so configurable legends are demonstrated with different labels and different legend lengths, rather than always using the default full context-window style set.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants Storybook to prove that `ContextStyleSet.legend` is genuinely caller-defined and can be much smaller than the built-in context-window vocabulary.

**Commit (code):** 4523db6551e17a87f9509cd803f1bdcddf2aa367 — "Storybook: vary context legend vocabularies"

### What I did

- Added compact style-set helpers inside `WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx`:
  - `fallbackVisualStyle`,
  - `visual(base, key)`,
  - `compactStyleSet(base, id, name, entries)`,
  - `compactPanelExamples(base)`.
- Reworked `ContextDiagramPanelViews` to render four different mini-vocabulary examples:
  - 3 visible labels: `Brief`, `Evidence`, `Draft` with hidden `Headroom`.
  - 4 visible labels: `Guardrails`, `Chat`, `Commands`, `Output` with hidden `Free`.
  - 5 labels: `Spec`, `Source files`, `Test logs`, `Answer`, `Spare room`.
  - 6 labels: `Keep verbatim`, `Summarize`, `Archive refs`, `Drop noise`, `New turn`, `Room after trim`.
- Ensured each example uses a different `initialView` (`strip`, `budget`, `stack`, `treemap`) and its own `ContextWindowSnapshot` with matching `styleKey` values.
- Reworked `ContextStackDiagram.stories.tsx` to show compact caller-defined vocabularies instead of default context kinds:
  - `Triage lanes`: `Must read`, `Reference`, `Noise`, with hidden `Room`.
  - `Turn timeline`: `Setup`, `Question`, `Work`, `Result`, `Reply`, `Unused`.
- Added visible `ContextLegend` instances to the stack diagram stories so the reduced legend sizes are obvious.

### Why

The hard cutover was not just about colors. It was about replacing baked-in context kinds with caller-provided `styleKey` and `ContextStyleSet`. Storybook needed to show smaller, domain-specific legends to make that capability obvious.

### What worked

- The same palette dropdown still changes the underlying colors/patterns while the legend vocabulary remains product/domain-specific.
- Hidden legend entries work as intended: snapshots can include style keys like `free` or `room`, while those entries do not have to appear in the visible legend.
- `ContextDiagramPanelViews` now demonstrates multiple legend sizes in a single Storybook view.

### What didn't work

- The first generation of controls made palette switching visible, but still used the full default legend almost everywhere. That visually implied the legend vocabulary was still fixed, even though the code was configurable.
- The story helper logic became longer because each compact example needs both a matching `styleSet` and matching `snapshot.parts[].styleKey` values.

### What I learned

- A good Storybook example for a configurable API should vary the shape of the data, not just the color values.
- Keeping palette and vocabulary separate is important: palette controls change color/pattern tones, while the story-specific style sets define the legend semantics.

### What was tricky to build

- Avoiding a mismatch between compact style-set keys and snapshot part `styleKey` values. Every mini snapshot needed to be authored as a coherent pair with its style set.
- Reusing visual styles from the selected base palette while replacing the legend vocabulary. The helper maps compact keys such as `brief` or `mustRead` to visual sources like `system`, `result`, or `active`.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether the specific mini vocabularies are the best examples for the product audience.
- Whether helper logic should move from the story file into a reusable `storyPalettes` utility if more stories need compact vocabularies.

### What should be done in the future

- Add one Goja DSL example that emits a compact style set with hidden free-space entries.
- Consider snapshot/story tests that assert legends do not always include the default 15 entries.

### Code review instructions

- Start at `WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx` and inspect `compactPanelExamples`.
- Then review `ContextStackDiagram.stories.tsx` for the triage/timeline vocabularies.
- Validate with `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck` and `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook`.

### Technical details

Validation passed:

- `pnpm typecheck` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`
- `pnpm build-storybook` in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`

## Step 11: Transcript Palette/Halftone Support — Work in Progress

This step began extending the context palette and halftone system from diagrams into transcript widgets. The screenshot showed transcript message cards, role labels, note chips, note cards, and a notes rail that still looked mostly neutral/static compared with the newly configurable context diagrams.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "add palette support / halftoning / tones for the transcript widgets too: /tmp/pi-clipboard-9007faaa-1c13-42f3-9332-5b4453ff691d.png"

**Assistant interpretation:** Extend `ContextStyleSet`-driven visual styling to transcript-related widgets and use the screenshot as a target for which areas need tone/halftone treatment.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants transcript UI elements to share the same palette-controlled visual language as context diagrams, including role tones, halftone textures, note tones, and Storybook/Widget IR configurability.

**Commit (code):** pending — transcript palette/halftone support is currently uncommitted and mid-edit

### What I did

- Used `ask_questions_about_images` on `/tmp/pi-clipboard-9007faaa-1c13-42f3-9332-5b4453ff691d.png` to identify visible transcript widgets and styling targets.
- The image analysis identified:
  - `TranscriptWorkspacePanel`,
  - `TranscriptReaderPanel`,
  - `TranscriptMessageCard`,
  - `AnnotationRailPanel`,
  - `AnnotationNoteCard`,
  - transcript/session header chrome,
  - inline note chips,
  - role glyphs/labels,
  - tool/code output blocks.
- Inspected transcript source files:
  - `TranscriptMessageCard.tsx`,
  - `TranscriptMessageCard.module.css`,
  - `TranscriptReaderPanel.tsx`,
  - `TranscriptWorkspacePanel.tsx`,
  - `AnnotationRailPanel.tsx`,
  - `AnnotationRailPanel.module.css`,
  - `AnnotationNoteCard.tsx`,
  - `AnnotationNoteCard.module.css`,
  - `TranscriptSessionHeader.tsx`,
  - `widgets/ir.ts`,
  - transcript widget adapters in `*.widget.tsx`.
- Added `transcriptStyleSet(...)` to `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/styles.ts` with transcript-oriented entries:
  - `system`,
  - `developer`,
  - `user`,
  - `assistant`,
  - `tool`,
  - `result`,
  - `note`,
  - `header`,
  - `rail`,
  - `code`,
  - `other`.
- Added transcript palette fixtures in `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/fixtures.ts`:
  - `transcriptDefaultStyleSet`,
  - `transcriptSignalOrangeStyleSet`,
  - `transcriptSlateCoralStyleSet`,
  - `transcriptCobaltSandStyleSet`.
- Extended `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/storyPalettes.ts` with:
  - `transcriptPaletteStyleSets`,
  - `transcriptStyleSetForPalette(palette)`.
- Began modifying `TranscriptMessageCard.tsx`:
  - added optional `styleSet?: ContextStyleSet`,
  - defaulted it to `transcriptDefaultStyleSet`,
  - resolved role style by transcript role (`user`, `assistant`, `tool`, etc.),
  - applied `contextVisualStyleToCssVars(...)`,
  - styled note chips with annotation style keys,
  - added code/tool-output CSS variables.
- Rewrote `TranscriptMessageCard.module.css` to support CSS variable-driven tones and halftone pattern classes:
  - `.pattern_none`,
  - `.pattern_solid`,
  - `.pattern_checker`,
  - `.pattern_diagonal`,
  - `.pattern_diagonalDense`,
  - `.pattern_stipple`,
  - `.pattern_cross`,
  - `.pattern_overflow`.

### Why

The diagrams now use palette-controlled halftone styles, but transcript widgets still used fixed role colors and neutral panels. This creates a split visual language. Transcript messages and notes are part of the same context-window product surface, so they should accept the same palette/tone infrastructure.

### What worked

- `ContextStyleSet` is general enough to represent transcript role tones as well as diagram segment styles.
- `contextVisualStyleToCssVars(...)` and `resolveContextVisualStyle(...)` can be reused directly by transcript components.
- Tool output blocks can use separate `code` tone variables while the outer message card uses the role tone.

### What didn't work

- I initially answered the screenshot question by using the image-analysis tool, not the `read` tool. The user then asked: `did you lok at the image with the read tool?`
- The transcript implementation is not complete yet. At the time of this diary backfill, these files are modified and uncommitted:
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/TranscriptMessageCard/TranscriptMessageCard.tsx`,
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/TranscriptMessageCard/TranscriptMessageCard.module.css`,
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/styles.ts`,
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/fixtures.ts`,
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/storyPalettes.ts`.
- `TranscriptReaderPanel`, `TranscriptWorkspacePanel`, `AnnotationRailPanel`, widget prop types, widget adapters, and Storybook stories still need to be finished and validated.

### What I learned

- Transcript styling has more surfaces than diagram styling: role card, title bar, role glyph, token chip, note chip, body, code/tool output block, selected state, rail chrome, and note card all need consistent treatment.
- Annotation DTOs already have `styleKey`, which can be used for note chips and note cards without inventing a second annotation tone system.
- Role styling should use transcript-specific style keys (`user`, `assistant`, `tool`, `system`, etc.) rather than diagram defaults like `conversation` or `result` alone.

### What was tricky to build

- The screenshot showed several nested components that visually belong together but are implemented in different files. Passing `styleSet` through the component tree needs to be done deliberately:
  - `TranscriptWorkspacePanel` should pass it to `TranscriptReaderPanel` and `AnnotationRailPanel`.
  - `TranscriptReaderPanel` should pass it to `TranscriptSessionHeader` and each `TranscriptMessageCard`.
  - `AnnotationRailPanel` should pass it to each `AnnotationNoteCard`.
  - Widget IR prop types and adapters need to expose the same optional `styleSet` prop.
- `kind` still exists legitimately in unrelated Widget IR action specs and annotation/message role data, so transcript styling must not repeat the earlier context-part hard cutover mistake of over-broad replacements.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether transcript role styles should be part of `ContextStyleSet` or a separate `TranscriptStyleSet` type. Reusing `ContextStyleSet` is pragmatic and keeps palettes unified, but the naming is diagram-originated.
- Whether selected/focused states should use the role's `line` color or a distinct global focus color.
- Whether code/tool-output halftoning is visually too busy for long logs.

### What should be done in the future

- Finish threading `styleSet` through transcript panels, annotation rail, note cards, and widget adapters.
- Add Storybook palette controls for transcript component and Widget IR stories.
- Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm build-storybook`.
- Optionally use the `read` tool on the screenshot path if the user wants the image handled directly by the file reader, not just the VLM image-analysis tool.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `context/styles.ts` and inspect `transcriptStyleSet(...)`.
- Then review `TranscriptMessageCard.tsx` and `TranscriptMessageCard.module.css` for how role tones and halftone classes are applied.
- Continue with the still-needed pass-through work in `TranscriptReaderPanel`, `TranscriptWorkspacePanel`, `AnnotationRailPanel`, and widget adapters once implemented.
- Validate with `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck` and `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook` after finishing the WIP.

## Step 12: Transcript Palette Foregrounds and Widget IR Story Controls

This step tightened the transcript palette treatment after visual review of the `Widget IR / Renderer / Transcript and Notes / MessageCardStates` story. The important correction is that palette colors are not enough by themselves: every colored header or chip also needs a deliberate foreground color or a neutral chip background so token counts and labels remain readable across palettes.

I kept the body-background rule from the prior clarification: transcript message bodies remain white/neutral by default, while role color, halftone, borders, glyphs, and token/note chrome live in the message title bar and related controls.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "for each palette color you should also define the color for text on top, like the 100 tok or so in http://localhost:6007/?path=/story/widget-ir-renderer-transcript-and-notes--message-card-states should either have white background or be matched to the background"

**Assistant interpretation:** Fix transcript palette rendering so foreground text over palette-colored areas is explicit and readable, especially the token-count chip in the Widget IR `MessageCardStates` story.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants palette theming to be usable in actual transcript stories, not just decorative; small labels and metadata must remain legible when background colors change.

**Commit (code):** 347b567 — "Frontend: add transcript palette foregrounds"

### What I did

- Updated `TranscriptMessageCard` so token counts render as `Caption tone="inherit"` with a dedicated `tokenChip` class.
- Constrained transcript palette fill and halftone patterns to the title/header strip; the message body remains `var(--mac-surface)` by default.
- Made title bar foreground use `--ctx-label`, which is derived from `ContextVisualStyle.labelColor`.
- Made token-count chips safe by giving them a mostly-white background mixed slightly with the palette fill and normal macOS text foreground.
- Added transcript style-set entries for annotation-style keys still used by fixtures: `context`, `generated`, and `active`.
- Threaded optional `styleSet` through transcript React components and Widget IR adapters:
  - `TranscriptMessageCard`
  - `TranscriptReaderPanel`
  - `TranscriptWorkspacePanel`
  - `AnnotationRailPanel`
  - `AnnotationNoteCard` widget adapter
- Reworked `WidgetRenderer.transcript-notes.stories.tsx` so the transcript-and-notes Widget IR stories expose a `palette` control and pass `transcriptStyleSetForPalette(palette)` into the rendered IR nodes.
- Ran validation:
  - `cd packages/rag-evaluation-site && pnpm typecheck`
  - `cd packages/rag-evaluation-site && pnpm build-storybook`

### Why

- Palette fills can make small metadata unreadable unless every filled surface also carries an explicit foreground policy.
- The token count (for example `100 tok`) is exactly the kind of small label that fails visually if it inherits muted text over a colored title bar.
- Widget IR stories need to receive the same style set as direct React stories so the renderer path is validated, not just the component path.

### What worked

- The existing `ContextVisualStyle.labelColor` maps naturally to `--ctx-label`, so the transcript title bar can reuse the same foreground mechanism as context diagrams.
- Giving token chips a neutral background avoids needing many per-palette chip-specific contrast rules.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed after threading `styleSet` through the IR interfaces and adapters.
- `pnpm build-storybook` completed successfully with the updated transcript stories.

### What didn't work

- `Caption` defaults to `tone="muted"`, so the token count did not inherit the title bar foreground until it was explicitly changed to `tone="inherit"`.
- The first attempt to update Widget IR interfaces with small text replacements was ambiguous because multiple transcript interfaces had identical `showAnnotationChips` / `onAnnotationSelectAction` blocks. I replaced the whole contiguous transcript interface block instead.

### What I learned

- Foreground policy must be part of the palette contract, not an afterthought applied only in CSS.
- The safest default for dense transcript content is colored chrome with neutral content bodies.
- Widget IR stories are a good regression surface because they reveal whether style-set props are actually serializable and passed through registry adapters.

### What was tricky to build

- The title bar needs palette foregrounds, but token chips should not necessarily sit directly on the colored fill. If the chip itself is lightly neutralized, it stays legible even when the title bar fill is saturated or patterned.
- Annotation chips use per-annotation style keys, while message title bars use role style keys. The solution was to resolve each chip's `annotation.styleKey` separately and pass those CSS variables directly to the button.
- The transcript fixture annotations reuse context-diagram semantic keys such as `context`, `generated`, and `active`; the transcript style set now includes those keys so annotation cards and chips do not fall back unpredictably.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether transcript styling should keep reusing `ContextStyleSet` long-term or split into a dedicated `TranscriptStyleSet` once transcript semantics diverge further.
- Whether the neutral token chip background should be fully white or slightly palette-tinted; the current implementation keeps it mostly white with a small fill mix.
- Whether `AnnotationNoteCard` should also move more color into its title/header strip and keep its body even more aggressively neutral.

### What should be done in the future

- Visually inspect the live `MessageCardStates` story across all palettes.
- Add a transcript-focused contrast regression story if these palettes become product-critical.
- Consider calculating foreground contrast from actual color values if future palettes include darker or more saturated fills.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/TranscriptMessageCard/TranscriptMessageCard.tsx` and its CSS module to review the title-bar-only palette behavior.
- Then inspect `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.transcript-notes.stories.tsx` to verify Widget IR palette control wiring.
- Validate with:
  - `cd packages/rag-evaluation-site && pnpm typecheck`
  - `cd packages/rag-evaluation-site && pnpm build-storybook`

### Technical details

- Token chip readability is handled by `Caption tone="inherit"` plus `.tokenChip` using a mostly-white background.
- Header text uses `--ctx-label`, derived from each `ContextVisualStyle.labelColor`.
- Message body background remains `var(--mac-surface)` by default.

## Step 13: Side-Note Palette Foregrounds

This step applies the transcript foreground rule to the side-note cards shown in transcript views. The note body stays neutral for readability, while the note title strip uses the annotation palette style, including explicit foreground color and halftone pattern.

The key visual target was the annotation rail and side-note cards that appear alongside transcript message states. These cards now behave like message title bars: palette color is chrome, not the default body background, and every colored header has a matching text color.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "do it for the side notes in the transcript views as well, like in Transcript and Notes / Message Card States and such"

**Assistant interpretation:** Extend the palette foreground and neutral-body treatment from transcript message cards to annotation side-note cards in transcript views and Widget IR stories.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants all transcript-adjacent colored surfaces, including side notes, to remain readable and visually consistent across palette choices.

**Commit (code):** 1577e2b — "Frontend: add side-note palette foregrounds"

### What I did

- Updated `AnnotationNoteCard` to resolve `annotation.styleKey` against the transcript style set by default.
- Applied `contextVisualStyleToCssVars()` to each note card so note headers get `--ctx-fill`, `--ctx-line`, `--ctx-stroke`, and `--ctx-label`.
- Added pattern classes for side-note title bars using the same halftone vocabulary as transcript message cards.
- Kept side-note bodies on `var(--mac-surface)` so longer note text remains neutral and readable.
- Added a safe neutral `confidenceChip` so confidence text does not sit directly on colored fills.
- Validated with:
  - `cd packages/rag-evaluation-site && pnpm typecheck`
  - `cd packages/rag-evaluation-site && pnpm build-storybook`

### Why

- Side notes are rendered in the same transcript views as message cards, so they need the same contrast and foreground rules.
- A fixed dark title bar did not reflect caller-selected transcript palettes.
- Applying palette fills to entire note cards would make note body text noisier, so the palette remains constrained to note chrome.

### What worked

- The side-note card already received `styleSet` through prior Widget IR work, so this step only needed to consume that prop fully.
- Reusing `ContextVisualStyle.labelColor` for `--ctx-label` gives note headers explicit readable foregrounds.
- Both TypeScript and Storybook production build passed after the CSS/TS changes.

### What didn't work

- N/A; the implementation was straightforward after the message-card foreground pattern was established.

### What I learned

- The same colored-chrome/neutral-body rule maps cleanly across transcript cards and side notes.
- Confidence captions need the same treatment as token chips: either neutral background or palette-matched foreground.

### What was tricky to build

- The note card has two visual indicators in the title strip: the `NOTE` label and the `ContextStyleSwatch`. The label needs to use `--ctx-label`, while the swatch can continue to show the underlying visual style directly.
- Selected side notes need a palette-aware border/shadow without turning the whole note body into a colored surface.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Whether the side-note title strip should be visually quieter than message title strips in dense annotation rails.
- Whether confidence chips should be shown as plain muted metadata instead of bordered chips in compact layouts.

### What should be done in the future

- Visually inspect the transcript-and-notes stories across all palettes, especially the annotation rail density.

### Code review instructions

- Review `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/AnnotationNoteCard/AnnotationNoteCard.tsx` for style-set consumption.
- Review `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/AnnotationNoteCard/AnnotationNoteCard.module.css` for title-bar-only palette behavior.
- Validate with:
  - `cd packages/rag-evaluation-site && pnpm typecheck`
  - `cd packages/rag-evaluation-site && pnpm build-storybook`

### Technical details

- Side-note header foreground comes from `--ctx-label`.
- Side-note body background remains `var(--mac-surface)`.
- Confidence metadata uses a mostly-white chip background mixed slightly with the note palette fill.
