# Diary

## Goal

Capture the research trail for integrating the new design iteration into a full transcript/context-window/annotation/course page experience, starting from prior Pi session evidence about frontend design-system and web/ playbooks.

## Step 1: Ticket Setup and go-minitrace Bootstrap

I created a dedicated docmgr ticket for the design-integration work and initialized the expected design document, diary, task list, and scripts workspace. The immediate objective is not to design from memory: it is to recover prior design-system/playbook knowledge from local Pi transcripts and make the search reproducible.

I started by following the go-minitrace transcript-analysis workflow: capture the built-in help tree, save reusable scripts under the ticket `scripts/` directory, and convert only relevant Pi session stores for this RAG evaluation workspace.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Create a new ticket to integrate the new design iteration to make a full transacript / context window / annotation page / course page for working on contgext windows and rag and all that.

First, we are going to use `go-minitrace help --all` and its SQL + jsverb scripting capabilities to find the design system playbooks we've surly written in pi sessions in this workspace.

Use go-minitrace and store all scripts you use in the scripts/ folder of the new ticket, keeping a detailed and frequent diary, to search for relevant documents that were written while we were working on web/

You can also use git + sqlite + other tools to do richer searches without having to look at a lot of information yourself."

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a docmgr ticket for a new frontend design-integration effort, then use go-minitrace-driven transcript search to recover previous design-system/web contribution playbooks and record every reusable command/script in the ticket.

**Inferred user intent:** Build the next design iteration on top of prior work and documented conventions rather than re-inventing frontend structure, especially for pages around transcripts, context windows, annotations, courses, and RAG workflows.

### What I did
- Ran `docmgr status --summary-only` to confirm the ticket root and vocabulary.
- Ran `go-minitrace help --all > /tmp/go-minitrace-help-all.txt` as the required first go-minitrace discovery step.
- Created ticket `RAGEVAL-CONTEXT-WINDOWS-DESIGN` titled `Transcript, Context Window, Annotation, and Course Page Design Integration`.
- Added design doc `design-doc/01-design-integration-research-and-implementation-plan.md`.
- Added this diary at `reference/01-investigation-diary.md`.
- Added four initial tasks covering transcript search, convention extraction, requirements mapping, and implementation planning.
- Wrote `scripts/01_capture_go_minitrace_help.sh` to capture `go-minitrace help --all` plus focused query/JS help pages into `sources/go-minitrace/`.
- Wrote `scripts/02_convert_relevant_pi_sessions.sh` to convert two relevant Pi session directories into `sources/minitrace/`.
- Ran both scripts successfully.

### Why
- The user explicitly asked for a new ticket, go-minitrace usage, scripts stored in the ticket, and a detailed/frequent diary.
- Capturing help output locally makes later SQL/JS command choices auditable.
- Converting only the two RAG workspace Pi session stores keeps the archive focused before deeper querying.

### What worked
- `docmgr status --summary-only` reported the repo-local ttmp root and existing vocabulary.
- `go-minitrace help --all` worked and produced 45 lines; the focused help pages produced 1,900 lines total.
- `go-minitrace convert pi` converted 18 total sessions across the outer workspace and nested git checkout session stores.
- The ticket now has a reproducible script trail rather than one-off shell history.

### What didn't work
- No blocker yet.
- Observation: `go-minitrace help --all` is only an index-sized output in this installed version, so I also captured focused help pages: `query-commands`, `query-duckdb`, `structured-query-commands`, `js-api-reference`, and `writing-duckdb-queries`.

### What I learned
- This docmgr root already has topics for `design-system`, `frontend-architecture`, `react`, `rag`, and `ui-dsl`, so the new ticket can stay vocabulary-clean.
- There are two relevant Pi session roots for this workspace:
  - `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--home-manuel-workspaces-2026-05-27-rag-evaluation-system--`
  - `~/.pi/agent/sessions/--home-manuel-workspaces-2026-05-27-rag-evaluation-system-2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system--`

### What was tricky to build
- The current working directory is the outer workspace, while the git/docmgr root is the nested `2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system` directory. I kept scripts and docmgr commands anchored under the nested repo so ticket paths resolve correctly.
- Prior Pi sessions may have been recorded from either the outer workspace or nested repo checkout, so the conversion script includes both session directories.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Confirm whether Codex transcript stores should also be included after the first Pi-only pass.
- Confirm whether other workspace directories, such as `ttc-design-system`, should be included if the recovered playbooks reference design-system work outside this repo.

### What should be done in the future
- Write and run saved SQL/JS query commands against the converted archive to rank candidate sessions and extract concrete file/doc references.
- Relate the scripts, help captures, and minitrace outputs to the ticket via docmgr once the first query pass identifies the most important artifacts.

### Code review instructions
- Start with `scripts/01_capture_go_minitrace_help.sh` and `scripts/02_convert_relevant_pi_sessions.sh`.
- Re-run them from the repo root with:
  - `ttmp/2026/06/07/RAGEVAL-CONTEXT-WINDOWS-DESIGN--transcript-context-window-annotation-and-course-page-design-integration/scripts/01_capture_go_minitrace_help.sh`
  - `ttmp/2026/06/07/RAGEVAL-CONTEXT-WINDOWS-DESIGN--transcript-context-window-annotation-and-course-page-design-integration/scripts/02_convert_relevant_pi_sessions.sh`

### Technical details
- Ticket path: `ttmp/2026/06/07/RAGEVAL-CONTEXT-WINDOWS-DESIGN--transcript-context-window-annotation-and-course-page-design-integration`
- Converted archive list: `sources/minitrace/archive-files.txt`
- Help capture directory: `sources/go-minitrace/`

## Step 2: SQL/JS Transcript Search and Recovered Design Sources

I moved from conversion into actual evidence extraction. The goal of this step was to use go-minitrace's SQL and JS command support to rank prior sessions and recover concrete documents, not to manually skim long transcripts.

The search found the expected prior work: an original RAG React design-system guideline/playbook from June 1, a follow-up audit, a current design reference pair from June 7, and Widget DSL packaging/visual-quality guides from June 4–5. I also used git history to find the strongest commit pointer for the original web design-system playbook.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 1)

**Assistant interpretation:** Use minitrace SQL/JS and other repository tools to find previously written frontend/design-system guidance and summarize the useful sources for the new ticket.

**Inferred user intent:** Recover prior contribution rules for `web/` and design-system work so the new transcript/context-window/annotation/course design can follow established conventions.

### What I did
- Wrote `scripts/03_candidate_session_search.sql`, a DuckDB query that unnests turns/tool calls and ranks sessions by `design system`, `playbook`, `web/`, `react`, `atoms`, `molecules`, `foundation`, `storybook`, `context window`, `transcript`, `annotation`, and `course` terms.
- Ran the SQL query via:
  - `go-minitrace query duckdb --archive-glob "$TICKET/sources/minitrace/*/active/*/*.minitrace.json" --sql-file "$TICKET/scripts/03_candidate_session_search.sql" --output json > "$TICKET/sources/candidate-session-search.json"`
- Wrote a JS query command at `scripts/query-commands/design/web-playbook-search.js` using `require("minitrace")` and `mt.query(...)`.
- Ran the JS command via `go-minitrace query commands --query-repository ... design web-playbook-search web-playbook-evidence ...` and saved `sources/web-playbook-evidence.json`.
- Wrote `scripts/04_git_frontend_history.sh` to capture git history and tracked frontend files for `web`, `packages/rag-evaluation-site`, `internal/web`, `pkg/widgetdsl`, `pkg/widgetserver`, and `pkg/widgetrunner`.
- Wrote `scripts/05_catalog_recovered_design_docs.py` to build `sources/01-recovered-design-docs.md`, a compact catalog of recovered docs and first headings.
- Updated the main design document with initial recovered guidance and an implementation plan.

### Why
- SQL gives a high-recall pass over session turns/tool outputs without manual transcript reading.
- The JS query command demonstrates the requested jsverb-style path and gives a place to evolve richer ranking logic.
- Git history catches committed design docs even when docmgr indexing misses or vocabulary/frontmatter is imperfect.

### What worked
- The SQL search ranked session `019e8afc-89d8-7f43-95d0-e7f6be234ee4` highest for combined design-system/frontend/playbook evidence.
- The minitrace evidence pointed directly to recent design-reference tickets and the Obsidian article path.
- Git history identified commit `1cb51dd` (`docs: audit RAG design system guidelines`) as the direct commit that added the RAG design-system guideline audit and related docs.
- The catalog script recovered these core documents:
  - `RAG React Design System Guidelines`
  - `RAG Design System Guideline Audit`
  - `Styling and Design Reference`
  - `Widget Hierarchy and Interaction Reference`
  - `Widget DSL Visual Quality Analysis and Implementation Guide`
  - `WidgetRenderer Packaging Architecture and Implementation Guide`
  - `UI DSL and Kanban DSL Design and Implementation Guide`
  - `RAG Widget DSL Design — Component-to-HTML Mapping`
  - `Review and Revised Implementation Guide for the RAG Widget DSL`

### What didn't work
- First JS command run failed with a DuckDB regexp error:
  - `Error: GoError: executing js query: Invalid Input Error: missing ): docmgr doc add|docmgr doc relate|write(|design-doc|reference|.md`
- I fixed it by replacing the problematic regex fragment with a bracket expression: `write[(]` and `[.]md`.
- The first run of `scripts/04_git_frontend_history.sh` failed with:
  - `fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git`
- Root cause: I computed the repo root with too many `..` segments from the ticket directory. I fixed `REPO_ROOT` from `../../../../../../..` to `../../../../..`.
- The first run of `scripts/05_catalog_recovered_design_docs.py` marked repo docs as missing because `REPO = parents[5]` resolved to `ttmp` rather than the repo root. I fixed it to `parents[6]`.

### What I learned
- The actual frontend contribution handbook already exists as `ttmp/2026/06/01/.../design-doc/02-rag-react-design-system-guidelines.md`; it just is not linked from `packages/rag-evaluation-site/README.md` or a top-level frontend `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- The current design reference is split into styling/design and widget hierarchy/interaction documents under `RAGEVAL-DS-RAGEVAL-QWEN36-HIGH`.
- The older `web/` design-system playbook and the newer `packages/rag-evaluation-site` Widget IR package docs need to be reconciled before implementation starts.

### What was tricky to build
- The minitrace query had to inspect both turn content and tool-call inputs/outputs because the important evidence appears in prompts, commands, generated file paths, and command output.
- Querying the current live session can pollute results because the current ticket creation also contains many target terms. I kept the output but treated it as low-value self-evidence, while relying on older high-score sessions and git commits for actual recovered sources.
- The generated ticket path is deeply nested, so scripts that infer repo root must be careful and should be re-run after edits.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The recovered design guidelines were written for `web/`, while the latest PR work introduced `packages/rag-evaluation-site`; we need a design decision on whether the new pages land in legacy `web/`, the package, or both.
- The catalog currently includes one Obsidian article referenced by transcripts. There may be additional external vault notes with less obvious filenames.

### What should be done in the future
- Read the recovered docs in detail and distill a short `CONTRIBUTING.md`/frontend playbook for future implementers.
- Use the recovered rules to decide exact component placement for transcript/context-window/annotation/course surfaces.
- Optionally add Codex transcript search if Pi transcripts do not cover all design iterations.

### Code review instructions
- Review `scripts/03_candidate_session_search.sql` for ranking terms and false positives.
- Review `scripts/query-commands/design/web-playbook-search.js` as the reusable JS command entrypoint.
- Review `sources/01-recovered-design-docs.md` to confirm the recovered source list is complete enough for planning.
- Validate by re-running scripts 03–05 after scripts 01–02 have created the minitrace archive.

### Technical details
- Candidate session search output: `sources/candidate-session-search.json`.
- JS command output: `sources/web-playbook-evidence.json`.
- Git history output: `sources/git/frontend-history.tsv` and `sources/git/frontend-history-with-files.txt`.
- Recovered source catalog: `sources/01-recovered-design-docs.md`.

## Step 3: Research Logbook for Future Minitrace Searches

I added a dedicated research logbook to capture which resources were useful, stale, incomplete, or need updates for the minitrace/session-log recovery process. This document is intentionally broader than the design-integration plan: it records the meta-process so the next transcript-mining task starts from tested resources and known failure modes.

The logbook covers go-minitrace skills/help pages, ticket-local scripts, generated evidence files, recovered design-system documents, the Obsidian article surfaced by transcripts, and the package README gap. It also records concrete update recommendations such as excluding current-session self-hits, generalizing repo-root discovery, and adding a worked example for “find prior project knowledge in local sessions.”

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Create a research logbook document in the ticket that allows us to keep track of which resources    
 are useful / out of date / need updating .                                                          
                                                                                                     
 For all the documents and external resources you read, list:                                        
                                                                                                     
 - what you were researching                                                                         
 - what you were looking for in this document in particular                                          
 - why you chose it
 - how you found the resource itself
 - what you found useful in the document                                                             
 - what you didn't find useful                                                                       
 - what is out of date / what was wrong                                                              
 - what would need updating.                                                                         
                                                                                                     
 Store in ticket and upload to remarkable.     

---

^^ this is regarding th eminitrace process, so that next time we have to look for information in session logs we have a better stsarting point."

**Assistant interpretation:** Add a ticket reference document that evaluates every resource consulted during the minitrace/session-log search process, then upload that logbook to reMarkable.

**Inferred user intent:** Build reusable process memory so future agents can mine session logs faster and know which go-minitrace docs, scripts, and recovered resources are reliable or stale.

### What I did
- Created `reference/02-research-logbook.md` with `docmgr doc add`.
- Wrote detailed entries for go-minitrace skills/help pages, ticket scripts, generated evidence outputs, recovered frontend/design-system docs, the Obsidian article, and the incomplete package README.
- Included the exact evaluation fields requested by the user for each resource.
- Related the logbook to the core ticket scripts and recovered-doc catalog.
- Updated the changelog for the new logbook.

### Why
- The previous design-integration doc explains what we found; this logbook explains how trustworthy each research input was and what should be updated before the process is reused.
- Future transcript searches need known-good starting points and known traps such as current-session self-hits.

### What worked
- `docmgr doc add` created the logbook at `reference/02-research-logbook.md`.
- The logbook now has a quick-reference status table plus detailed per-resource notes.
- `docmgr doc relate` successfully related the document after frontmatter was fixed.

### What didn't work
- The first `docmgr doc relate` failed because I used object entries under `ExternalSources`:
  - `line 25: cannot unmarshal !!map into string`
- I fixed this by changing `ExternalSources` back to `[]` and keeping the Obsidian path in the body.

### What I learned
- In this docmgr frontmatter schema, `ExternalSources` is not the same shape as `RelatedFiles`; map entries with `Path`/`Note` are invalid there.
- The most valuable future improvement is not another manual note: it is making the minitrace scripts exclude the current session and auto-catalog candidate docs.

### What was tricky to build
- The logbook needs to be useful for process reuse, not just a bibliography. I kept each resource entry structured around the user’s requested evaluation questions and added a summary table for quick scanning.
- Some resources are both useful and stale. The older component-to-HTML DSL mapping, for example, remains useful as a widget catalog but is architecturally superseded by Widget IR rendered by React.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The list of resources is based on what was read during this session and the previous recovery pass; there may be additional Codex or Obsidian resources not yet included.
- The “out of date” judgments should be checked against current code before turning them into doc updates.

### What should be done in the future
- Add current-session exclusion to `03_candidate_session_search.sql` and `web-playbook-search.js`.
- Generalize `05_catalog_recovered_design_docs.py` so candidate docs are discovered from query/git output.
- Create a concise minitrace “prior project knowledge recovery” playbook using this logbook as source material.

### Code review instructions
- Start with `reference/02-research-logbook.md`.
- Check that each resource entry answers the user’s requested questions.
- Run `docmgr doctor --ticket RAGEVAL-CONTEXT-WINDOWS-DESIGN --stale-after 30` after edits.

### Technical details
- Logbook path: `ttmp/2026/06/07/RAGEVAL-CONTEXT-WINDOWS-DESIGN--transcript-context-window-annotation-and-course-page-design-integration/reference/02-research-logbook.md`.

## Step 3: Source Management and Context Viewer Analysis

I copied the recovered design-system and Widget DSL documents into this ticket's `sources/` directory and unpacked the new `context-viewer.zip` design iteration into a dedicated source subdirectory. After the user clarified that this pass should be analysis-first rather than an integration plan, I shaped the new guide around understanding the updated work, mapping its concepts, and identifying likely integration surfaces without prescribing a detailed implementation order.

The resulting analysis treats the context-viewer code as a prototype and product/design artifact: it has valuable screens, interaction states, typography adjustments, diagram vocabulary, and annotation patterns, but it should not be copied directly as production React because it uses global scripts, inline styles, CDN React/Babel, and `window` exports.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "cp them into the sources/ directory of the new ticket and make an index.md in that directory to explain what they are, how they were found, what they are useful for. That way we capture what we are starting with.

Then, unzip ~/Downloads/context-viewer.zip into a subdirectory in sources/ as well. This is the updated version of our design system, with new widgets and potentially states and such. This is the stuff we want to add to the existing design system, while keeping the rest working. I think there are slight stylistic adjustments in the typography which I personally like. But anyway. Manage the sources, and then Create  a detailed analysis / design / implementation guide that is for a new intern, explaining all the parts of the system needed to understand what it is, with prose paragraphs and bullet point sand pseudocode and diagrams and api references and file references. It should be very clear and technical. Store in the ticket and the nupload to remarkable."

**Assistant interpretation:** Preserve the recovered baseline docs and new prototype zip as local ticket sources, write an intern-friendly technical analysis guide focused on understanding the updated design iteration and integration concepts, and upload the resulting guide bundle to reMarkable.

**Inferred user intent:** Make the starting point durable and reviewable before coding, so the future integration of the context-viewer design system can preserve existing behavior while adopting the new typography, widgets, states, and product surfaces.

### What I did
- Copied the most relevant recovered docs into `sources/02-recovered-documents/`.
- Unpacked `~/Downloads/context-viewer.zip` into `sources/03-context-viewer-design-iteration/`.
- Copied the original zip into `sources/03-context-viewer-design-iteration/context-viewer.zip` for provenance.
- Wrote `sources/index.md` explaining the source corpus, how the docs were found, why each copied document matters, and what each context-viewer file contains.
- Generated file lists and checksums:
  - `sources/02-recovered-documents/00-file-list.txt`
  - `sources/03-context-viewer-file-list.txt`
  - `sources/03-context-viewer-sha256.txt`
- Wrote `scripts/06_analyze_context_viewer_sources.py` to extract a compact source map from the prototype.
- Generated `sources/04-context-viewer-source-map.md` and `.json`.
- Added `design-doc/02-context-viewer-design-iteration-analysis.md`, an analysis-first intern guide with source references, DTO sketches, pseudocode, API references, and integration concept maps.
- Related the analysis doc to the source index, source map, key prototype files, `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/ir.ts`, and `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go`.
- Checked tasks 3 and 4.

### Why
- The user asked to capture the starting source material before integration.
- The new prototype has many valuable ideas but also many throwaway implementation choices, so an analysis boundary is necessary before implementation planning.
- Copying sources locally avoids future ambiguity if the original ticket docs or `~/Downloads/context-viewer.zip` move or change.

### What worked
- The source bundle is now self-contained under the ticket.
- The context-viewer zip unpacked cleanly into 17 original files plus the copied zip provenance artifact.
- The analysis identified the key new subsystems: typography adjustments, grouped studio navigation, context-window diagram language, visualizer/budget inspector, upload parser workflow, annotated transcript rail, anchored comments, course/slides/handout surfaces, and design tweak controls.
- The guide explicitly distinguishes implementation concepts from a future detailed implementation plan.

### What didn't work
- The first checksum command failed because paths with spaces were passed through command substitution:
  - `sha256sum: ./Design: No such file or directory`
  - `sha256sum: System.html: No such file or directory`
- I fixed it by switching to a null-delimited pipeline:
  - `find . -type f -print0 | sort -z | xargs -0 sha256sum > ../03-context-viewer-sha256.txt`
- The first source-map script over-collected CSS classes from JSX property access because it applied a generic `.class` regex to all files. I rewrote it to extract functions/constants from JSX and CSS variables/classes only from `.css` files.
- `docmgr doctor` reports warnings because the user explicitly requested `sources/index.md`; docmgr prefers only one `index.md` per ticket and numeric prefixes for docs under subdirectories.

### What I learned
- The prototype's strongest reusable subsystem is the context-window diagram language (`patterns.jsx` + `diagrams.jsx`), not the duplicated primitive components.
- The typography change is systematic: body/compact/metric/code roles are slightly larger and more readable while staying dense.
- The transcript and comments screens provide concrete annotation interaction states that were not present in the old design-system docs.
- The right integration frame is: analyze prototype → promote concepts into layers → only later expose stable concepts through Widget IR recipes.

### What was tricky to build
- The user requested an `index.md` under `sources/`, which is useful for humans but conflicts with docmgr's single-index hygiene rule. I kept the requested filename and will call out the warning in handoff.
- The guide had to avoid becoming a detailed implementation plan while still being useful to an intern. I handled this by writing API sketches, DTOs, component landing-zone maps, and an “integration concept map” rather than ordered coding phases.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Whether the prototype's typography should become the new default or a page-mode/theme variant.
- Whether `MacWindow` and `MenuBar` are appropriate product chrome for the context studio, given earlier RAG dashboard guidance preferred no window chrome.
- Whether new context-window components should land first in `web/`, `packages/rag-evaluation-site`, or both.

### What should be done in the future
- Capture screenshots of every prototype screen.
- Build a component promotion table from prototype function to existing/new component layer.
- Decide the frontend target boundary before any implementation begins.
- Define canonical DTOs for context windows, transcripts, annotations, comments, slides, and handouts.

### Code review instructions
- Start with `sources/index.md` to understand the source corpus.
- Then read `design-doc/02-context-viewer-design-iteration-analysis.md`.
- Use `sources/04-context-viewer-source-map.md` to navigate the prototype quickly.
- Inspect `sources/03-context-viewer-design-iteration/patterns.jsx`, `diagrams.jsx`, `screens2.jsx`, and `screens3.jsx` for the highest-value new concepts.

### Technical details
- Original zip: `~/Downloads/context-viewer.zip`.
- Unpacked copy: `sources/03-context-viewer-design-iteration/`.
- Source index: `sources/index.md`.
- Analysis doc: `design-doc/02-context-viewer-design-iteration-analysis.md`.

## Step 4: Add Web Frontend README Pointer and Glossary

I added a `web/README.md` so future contributors can find the recovered design-system guidance without needing to know the docmgr ticket path first. The README does not duplicate the full analysis; it gives a compact primer, glossary, contribution checklist, and links to the current source documents.

This keeps the detailed analysis in the ticket while making the active frontend directory self-describing.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "you have a nice glossary in the current system primer. And just in general the guidance is good. Add it to web/README.md or have README.md point at the proper resources."

**Assistant interpretation:** Add contributor-facing frontend documentation in `web/README.md` that includes the glossary and points to the detailed ticket resources.

**Inferred user intent:** Make the design-system/contribution guidance discoverable from the web frontend directory before anyone starts editing components.

### What I did
- Created `web/README.md`.
- Included commands, architecture primer, glossary, contribution checklist, and links to current recovered references.
- Linked the context-viewer analysis and source index from the README.

### Why
- The guidance was useful but buried in a ticket design doc.
- `web/` had no README, so contributors had no local entrypoint for design-system conventions.

### What worked
- The README now points at the current June 7 design references and context-viewer source bundle.
- The glossary captures both existing frontend layers and new context-window/annotation terminology.

### What didn't work
- N/A

### What I learned
- The best short-term path is a discoverability README rather than moving all long-form design docs into `web/`.

### What was tricky to build
- The README needed to be useful on its own while avoiding drift from the ticket docs. I kept the detailed content in links and only duplicated compact glossary/checklist material.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Confirm whether the `web/README.md` should also link to `packages/rag-evaluation-site/README.md` once package-specific contribution guidance is added.

### What should be done in the future
- Add a similar short README or CONTRIBUTING file under `packages/rag-evaluation-site` if that package becomes the integration target.

### Code review instructions
- Start with `web/README.md`.
- Check that all relative links resolve from the `web/` directory.
