# Diary

## Goal

Capture the work to create a new ticket and write an intern-oriented design/implementation guide for expanding Widget IR, WidgetRenderer, and widget.dsl support to the newer design-system package components.

## Step 1: Create Ticket, Gather Evidence, and Write the Implementation Guide

I created a dedicated ticket for semantic Widget IR component support and used it as an evidence-backed design workspace. The investigation centered on the existing Widget IR runtime, the Goja `widget.dsl` module, the server/schema/runtime path, the newly expanded package component exports, and the Obsidian article about semantic recipes on top of Widget IR.

The resulting design guide explains the complete system for a new intern: how Goja scripts produce JSON Widget IR, how the Go server serves pages and actions, how the packaged React app loads those pages, how `WidgetRenderer` maps semantic nodes to actual package components, and how the implementation should be phased across TypeScript, Go, schemas, stories, and tests.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Let's actually tackle a new ticket, which is to add proper IR widgetrenderer support for the immense amount of new atoms and molecules and organisms and pages we have been adding. 

See /home/manuel/code/wesen/go-go-golems/go-go-parc/Projects/2026/06/06/RAG-EVAL DSL/ARTICLE - Semantic Recipes on Top of Widget IR.md (and past tickets in this repo as well, and of course the proper implementation itself), and Create  a detailed analysis / design / implementation guide that is for a new intern, explaining all the parts of the system needed to understand what it is, with prose paragraphs and bullet point sand pseudocode and diagrams and api references and file references. It should be very clear and technical. Store in the ticket and the nupload to remarkable."

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a new docmgr ticket, research the existing Widget IR/WidgetRenderer/widget.dsl architecture plus prior guidance, then write and upload a clear technical implementation guide for extending IR support to the expanded package component vocabulary.

**Inferred user intent:** Prepare a future implementer or intern to safely add semantic Widget IR support without regressing the design-system architecture or repeating the earlier Go-generated-HTML mistake.

### What I did
- Loaded the ticket-research writing-style and deliverable-checklist references.
- Created ticket `RAGEVAL-WIDGET-IR-SEMANTIC-COMPONENTS`.
- Added design document `design-doc/01-semantic-widget-ir-component-support-implementation-guide.md`.
- Added this investigation diary.
- Copied the Obsidian source article into `sources/semantic-recipes-on-top-of-widget-ir.md` for ticket-local review.
- Added scripts:
  - `scripts/01_collect_widget_ir_evidence.sh`
  - `scripts/02_extract_line_references.sh`
- Collected evidence into:
  - `sources/01-widget-ir-evidence.txt`
  - `sources/02-line-references.md`
  - `sources/03-component-api-surface.txt`
- Read and referenced the current implementation files for Widget IR, renderer, actions, cell renderers, Goja DSL helpers, widget schema, widget server, widget runner tests, app shell, context DTOs, package exports, and package guidelines.
- Wrote an implementation guide with system diagrams, API sketches, pseudocode, phased implementation steps, testing strategy, decision records, and file references.

### Why
- The package now has many stable reusable components that are not yet available to Widget IR authors.
- The existing DSL already supports semantic recipes, but only for the earlier smaller component vocabulary.
- A new implementer needs the full architecture before adding many renderer cases and Goja helpers.
- Prior docs warn against direct HTML generation; this guide reinforces the React-rendered Widget IR model.

### What worked
- `docmgr ticket create-ticket` created the workspace successfully.
- `docmgr doc add` created both the design doc and diary.
- Evidence collection scripts ran successfully after correcting the WidgetRenderer story path from `src/WidgetRenderer.stories.tsx` to `src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.stories.tsx`.
- The current source files provide a clear implementation pattern: TypeScript IR type, renderer case, Goja helper, schema component list, Storybook story, Go test.
- The Obsidian semantic-recipes article aligned with the package guideline that high-level recipes should expand into existing Widget IR, not render UI themselves.

### What didn't work
- The first run of `scripts/02_extract_line_references.sh` failed with:
  - `nl: /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-05-27/rag-evaluation-system/2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/WidgetRenderer.stories.tsx: No such file or directory`
- The actual file is `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.stories.tsx`.
- I fixed the script and reran it successfully.

### What I learned
- The current IR implementation is intentionally permissive at the JSON Schema layer but explicit at the TypeScript renderer layer.
- The package context DTOs are already JSON-compatible enough to reuse in new IR prop interfaces.
- The direct helper mechanism in `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go` is generic enough for many new components; recipes only need custom Go functions when they normalize data or expand common compositions.
- The action model is already capable of supporting callback-like props through `ActionSpec`, as long as the renderer constructs useful action context payloads.

### What was tricky to build
- The main design challenge was not listing every new component; it was deciding which components deserve direct nodes, which should be recipes, and which should be deferred.
- Another sharp edge is the callback boundary: React components use functions, while Widget IR must remain JSON. The design resolves this by adding explicit `on...Action` props and binding them in `WidgetRenderer`.
- Slot props such as `SplitPane.left`, `SidebarShell.sidebar`, and `SlideShell.visual` require `WidgetNode` props rather than ReactNode props, so the renderer needs helper functions to render node-valued props.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- The proposed first PR slice should be reviewed for scope. It may still be too broad if the implementation includes all foundation/atom/layout additions at once.
- The schema versioning decision (`0.1.0` vs `0.2.0`) should be confirmed before implementation.
- The exact names of direct Goja helpers, especially `textBlock` for the `Text` component, should be accepted before coding.
- The relationship between `CourseStudioShell` default navigation and JSON-provided navigation sections should be reviewed.

### What should be done in the future
- Implement Phase 1 from the design doc: foundation/atom/layout IR support.
- Follow with context diagrams, transcript/annotations, and course/handout recipes in separate commits or PRs.
- Add WidgetRenderer visual stories and Go JSON serialization tests for each phase.

### Code review instructions
- Start with `design-doc/01-semantic-widget-ir-component-support-implementation-guide.md`.
- Verify the evidence files under `sources/` if a claim needs line-level support.
- Confirm that the implementation plan updates all five required surfaces: TypeScript IR, React renderer, Goja DSL, widget schema, and tests/stories.
- Validate with `docmgr doctor --ticket RAGEVAL-WIDGET-IR-SEMANTIC-COMPONENTS --stale-after 30` before handoff.

### Technical details
- Primary files studied:
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/ir.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/actions.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/cellRenderers.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/app/App.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/types.ts`
  - `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go`
  - `pkg/widgetdsl/module_test.go`
  - `pkg/widgetschema/schema.go`
  - `pkg/widgetserver/server.go`
  - `pkg/widgetrunner/runner_test.go`
- Core design recommendation:
  - Add direct semantic component nodes for stable JSON-compatible components.
  - Add high-level recipes for context/transcript/course/handout page compositions.
  - Keep React components as the rendering source of truth.

## Step 2: Add Granular Phase Task List

I added a separate phased implementation task list so the design guide now has an executable companion checklist. The new document decomposes the whole Widget IR expansion into baseline, renderer, Goja helper, context diagram, transcript, course/handout, recipe, schema/docs, validation, and handoff phases.

The plan clarifies that Phase 1 extends the existing `WidgetRenderer` in place, then subsequent phases add Goja helpers, schema entries, DTO-heavy components, semantic recipes, and end-to-end validation. Each phase includes files to edit, component scope, tests, Storybook stories, and done criteria.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "create phases and then per phase, granular detailed list of tasks for the whoel thing."

**Assistant interpretation:** Add a full phase-by-phase implementation task plan for the entire semantic Widget IR effort, detailed enough for an intern to execute.

**Inferred user intent:** Turn the high-level design guide into an actionable implementation checklist with clear sequencing and review boundaries.

### What I did
- Added `reference/02-phased-implementation-task-list.md`.
- Broke the work into phases 0 through 9.
- Added granular checklists for TypeScript IR, React renderer, WidgetRenderer stories, Goja helpers, schema updates, tests, validation, docs, commits, and handoff.
- Updated `tasks.md` to mark the task list as complete.

### Why
- The main design guide explains the architecture, but implementers need a concrete task board.
- The phase split reduces risk by proving foundation/atom/layout support before context, transcript, course, and recipe work.
- The checklist makes it harder to forget synchronization points such as `pkg/widgetschema/schema.go` or `pkg/widgetdsl/module_test.go`.

### What worked
- The task list now states the exact extension points and done criteria for each phase.
- Phase 1 is clearly scoped as an in-place extension of existing Widget IR and `WidgetRenderer`.

### What didn't work
- N/A

### What I learned
- The implementation needs two early phases, not one: TypeScript renderer support first, then Goja/schema support for the same low-risk components.
- Separating semantic recipes into their own later phase keeps direct renderer support reviewable.

### What was tricky to build
- The main tricky part was balancing granularity with sequence. If Goja helpers are added before renderer stories, authors can produce nodes that are not yet visually proven. The plan therefore asks for renderer stories before broad recipe work.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Review whether `SlideShell` should be Phase 1 or Phase 5.
- Review whether Phase 2 should be merged with Phase 1 in one commit or kept separate.

### What should be done in the future
- Use `reference/02-phased-implementation-task-list.md` as the checklist when coding starts.
- Update checkboxes after each implementation phase.

### Code review instructions
- Review `reference/02-phased-implementation-task-list.md` for phase order and scope.
- Confirm the proposed commit slices match the desired PR/review cadence.

### Technical details
- The plan uses these recurring synchronization points:
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/ir.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.stories.tsx`
  - `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go`
  - `pkg/widgetdsl/module_test.go`
  - `pkg/widgetschema/schema.go`

## Step 3: Add Widget IR Storybook Story Matrix

I expanded the phased task list with a dedicated Widget IR Storybook story matrix. The new section keeps all renderer validation stories under the `Widget IR/Renderer/...` mantle while splitting them into navigable subgroups for foundation/atoms, layout recipes, context diagrams, transcripts and notes, course studio, handout documents, composed workflows, and actions/edge cases.

This was added because individual renderer cases are not enough. The expanded Widget IR surface must prove that new components compose well together in realistic product scenes: transcript review workbenches, context studio overviews, course slides with context visuals, handout readers, and legacy RAG dashboards enhanced with new components.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Add tasks to write stories for all these different combinations under the widget IR storybook mantle, but then split into subgroups, since we have so many possibilities. We want to see these things being combined in interesting ways."

**Assistant interpretation:** Extend the implementation task list with a detailed Storybook plan for many Widget IR combinations, organized into subgroups under the Widget IR renderer story hierarchy.

**Inferred user intent:** Ensure the implementation validates real compositional usage, not only one isolated story per component.

### What I did
- Added `Cross-phase Widget IR Storybook story matrix` to `reference/02-phased-implementation-task-list.md`.
- Added subgroup title conventions under `Widget IR/Renderer/...`.
- Added story tasks for:
  - Foundation and atoms
  - Layout recipes
  - Context diagrams
  - Transcript and notes
  - Course studio
  - Handout documents
  - Composed workflows
  - Actions and edge cases
- Added cross-story quality tasks for deterministic fixtures, action loggers, overflow states, and screenshot capture.
- Updated `tasks.md` to record the Storybook matrix addition.

### Why
- Widget IR needs to prove component composition, not just component existence.
- The renderer story catalog would become unmanageable if every scenario stayed in one flat Storybook list.
- Subgroups make visual review and implementation progress easier to navigate.

### What worked
- The task list now gives concrete story names and the renderer behavior each group should prove.
- It explicitly requires every story to render through `<WidgetRenderer node={...} />`, preserving the validation path.

### What didn't work
- N/A

### What I learned
- The highest-value stories are cross-feature compositions: transcript plus comments, course plus handout, context diagram plus metadata sidebar, and legacy dashboards enhanced with new atoms/layout.

### What was tricky to build
- The tricky part was keeping the story matrix broad enough to cover interesting combinations without turning it into implementation code. The plan therefore lists story intent and required components, but leaves exact fixture shape to the implementation phase.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Review whether the subgroup names match the desired Storybook navigation taxonomy.
- Review whether action-logger stories should be implemented with Storybook actions, custom stateful render wrappers, or a small shared helper.

### What should be done in the future
- When implementation begins, create story files incrementally per subgroup rather than one enormous story file.
- Link screenshots or Storybook URLs in the diary after each subgroup lands.

### Code review instructions
- Review the new `Cross-phase Widget IR Storybook story matrix` section in `reference/02-phased-implementation-task-list.md`.
- Confirm that each subgroup validates renderer behavior through IR rather than direct JSX.

### Technical details
- Proposed Storybook mantle/subgroups:
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Foundation and Atoms/...`
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Layout Recipes/...`
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Context Diagrams/...`
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Transcript and Notes/...`
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Course Studio/...`
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Handout Documents/...`
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Composed Workflows/...`
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Actions and Edge Cases/...`

## Step 4: Implement Phase 0, Phase 1, and Phase 2 Foundation IR Support

I started the implementation work from the phase plan and completed the low-risk foundation/atom/layout slice. This extends the existing Widget IR system in place: `ir.ts` now knows about the new component types, `WidgetRenderer.tsx` renders them through the real package components, Storybook has grouped Widget IR stories for foundation/atoms and layout recipes, and `widget.dsl` exposes matching Goja helpers.

This is the first proof that the plan works end-to-end without introducing a second renderer. JSON IR nodes such as `Text`, `ContextKindSwatch`, `SectionBlock`, `SplitPane`, and `SidebarShell` now render via the existing React `WidgetRenderer`, and Goja authors can create the same nodes through helper functions such as `rag.textBlock()`, `rag.contextKindSwatch()`, `rag.sectionBlock()`, `rag.splitPane()`, and `rag.sidebarShell()`.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Now work on these tasks one by one, commit at appropriate intervals, keep a diary as you work. I am going to go swimming and I want to have done verything when I come back. No faltering."

**Assistant interpretation:** Begin executing the phased Widget IR implementation plan, keep diary updates, validate frequently, and commit coherent slices.

**Inferred user intent:** Make tangible implementation progress across the Widget IR roadmap while the user is away, with enough documentation and commits to review safely later.

### What I did
- Ran Phase 0 baseline validation:
  - `git status --short`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build`
  - `go test ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/widgetrunner ./pkg/widgetserver ./pkg/widgetschema -count=1`
- Extended `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/ir.ts` with Phase 1 component types and prop interfaces:
  - `Text`, `CodeText`, `Divider`
  - `ContextKindSwatch`, `AnnotationBadge`, `TranscriptRoleBadge`
  - `SectionBlock`, `SplitPane`, `SidebarShell`
- Extended `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.tsx` with explicit switch cases and render helpers for those components.
- Added `renderNodeProp()` for `WidgetNode` slot props used by `SplitPane` and `SidebarShell`.
- Added grouped Widget IR Storybook files:
  - `WidgetRenderer.foundation-atoms.stories.tsx`
  - `WidgetRenderer.layout-recipes.stories.tsx`
- Extended `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go` with direct Goja helpers:
  - `textBlock`, `codeText`, `divider`
  - `contextKindSwatch`, `annotationBadge`, `transcriptRoleBadge`
  - `sectionBlock`, `splitPane`, `sidebarShell`
- Extended `pkg/widgetschema/schema.go` with the new component names.
- Extended Go tests in `pkg/widgetdsl/module_test.go` and `pkg/widgetserver/server_test.go`.

### Why
- Phase 1 and Phase 2 are the smallest safe end-to-end slice: they cover scalar props, children, slot props, direct renderer cases, Goja helpers, schema discovery, and Storybook grouping without DTO-heavy organisms.
- This establishes the exact pattern needed for later context diagrams, transcripts, course, and handout support.

### What worked
- Baseline package validation passed before implementation.
- Phase 1 package validation passed after implementation:
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site exec storybook build --output-dir /tmp/rag-package-storybook-widget-ir-phase-1`
- Phase 2 Go validation passed:
  - `go test ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/widgetrunner ./pkg/widgetserver ./pkg/widgetschema -count=1`
- Storybook build now includes the subgroup files under `Widget IR/Renderer/Foundation and Atoms` and `Widget IR/Renderer/Layout Recipes`.

### What didn't work
- First Phase 1 typecheck failed because I used `sidebar` as a `SplitPane` ratio in the IR and story, but the actual `SplitPane` component supports `balanced`, `leftNarrow`, `rightNarrow`, and `course`.
- Exact error:
  - `Type '"course" | "sidebar" | "balanced" | undefined' is not assignable to type '"course" | "balanced" | "leftNarrow" | "rightNarrow" | undefined'.`
- I fixed the IR prop type and story to use `leftNarrow`.

### What I learned
- Slot-prop components can be represented cleanly with `WidgetNode` props and a small renderer helper.
- The direct `componentFactory` in Goja is already enough for the Phase 1 helper set; no custom Go functions were needed.
- `rag.text()` must remain a raw text-node helper, so `rag.textBlock()` is the right DSL helper name for the React `Text` component.

### What was tricky to build
- The main sharp edge was keeping TypeScript IR prop unions aligned with the actual component prop unions. The `SplitPane` ratio mismatch showed why Phase 1 should remain small and heavily typechecked.
- Another subtle point is that `CodeText` copyability only copies when its React `children` is a string; WidgetRenderer passes children as React nodes. This is acceptable for now because action-based copy remains available through Button/action specs, but it should be reviewed if authors expect `CodeText.copyable` to work from IR text children.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Confirm whether `CodeText.copyable` should be supported from Widget IR or omitted from the IR prop interface until a string-value prop exists.
- Review whether `style` pass-through should remain ignored for these new components, matching most existing renderer helpers, or selectively supported.
- Review whether `SidebarShell.sidebarWidth` should accept only numbers in IR or also CSS strings.

### What should be done in the future
- Continue with Phase 3 context diagram nodes.
- Add browser visual sanity screenshots for the new grouped Widget IR stories.
- Update the phase task list checkboxes after the first commit lands.

### Code review instructions
- Start in `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/ir.ts` and review new prop interfaces.
- Then review `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.tsx` for explicit prop mapping.
- Review Storybook groups:
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Foundation and Atoms`
  - `Widget IR/Renderer/Layout Recipes`
- Review Go helper additions in `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go` and tests in `pkg/widgetdsl/module_test.go`.
- Validate with:
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site exec storybook build --output-dir /tmp/rag-package-storybook-widget-ir-phase-1`
  - `go test ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/widgetrunner ./pkg/widgetserver ./pkg/widgetschema -count=1`

### Technical details
- New DSL helper distinction:
  - `rag.text("...")` creates `{ kind: "text" }`.
  - `rag.textBlock({...}, "...")` creates `{ kind: "component", type: "Text" }`.

## Step 5: Add Context Diagram Widget IR Support

I completed the next implementation slice for context-window visualizations. Widget IR now supports the context legend, budget bar, strip diagram, stack diagram, treemap, and the higher-level `ContextDiagramPanel` organism. The implementation again extends the existing renderer and DSL surfaces rather than creating any separate rendering path.

I also added a grouped Storybook file under `Widget IR/Renderer/Context Diagrams` with stories that combine multiple diagram types, a diagram panel mode gallery, a metadata sidebar composition, and an over-budget context-window state. This starts exercising the “interesting combinations” story matrix rather than only one component at a time.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 4)

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue executing the phased Widget IR implementation plan and commit coherent slices with diary updates.

**Inferred user intent:** Keep making concrete progress through the component families while maintaining reviewable commits and validation evidence.

### What I did
- Added context diagram prop interfaces to `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/ir.ts`.
- Added renderer imports, switch cases, and render helpers in `WidgetRenderer.tsx` for:
  - `ContextLegend`
  - `ContextBudgetBar`
  - `ContextStripDiagram`
  - `ContextStackDiagram`
  - `ContextTreemap`
  - `ContextDiagramPanel`
- Added `WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx` with subgroup title `Widget IR/Renderer/Context Diagrams`.
- Added Goja helper mappings in `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go`.
- Added schema component names in `pkg/widgetschema/schema.go`.
- Added Go JSON serialization coverage for a context diagram page in `pkg/widgetdsl/module_test.go`.
- Extended schema endpoint test coverage in `pkg/widgetserver/server_test.go`.

### Why
- Context diagrams are the next lowest-risk DTO-backed family because their props are already JSON-compatible `ContextWindowSnapshot` objects.
- The diagrams are central to the context-viewer work and should be available both as low-level diagrams and as `ContextDiagramPanel`.

### What worked
- `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build` passed.
- `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site exec storybook build --output-dir /tmp/rag-package-storybook-widget-ir-phase-3` passed.
- `go test ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/widgetrunner ./pkg/widgetserver ./pkg/widgetschema -count=1` passed.

### What didn't work
- N/A

### What I learned
- The context diagram family fits the direct-node model cleanly because the React components already accept DTO-shaped props.
- `ContextDiagramPanel` is stateful internally for view switching, but its initial state and selected part are still safely representable in JSON IR.

### What was tricky to build
- The diagram components do not all expose identical props: `ContextBudgetBar` and `ContextStripDiagram` accept `mode`, while `ContextStackDiagram` and `ContextTreemap` do not. The IR prop interfaces intentionally mirror the real component APIs instead of inventing a fake unified shape.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes
- Confirm whether the IR should eventually add `onPartSelectAction`; current React context diagram components do not expose selection callbacks, so this was deferred.
- Review whether `ContextDiagramPanel.initialView` should be renamed at the IR level to `view` for author ergonomics, or kept identical to React props for simplicity.

### What should be done in the future
- Proceed to transcript/annotation/comment Widget IR support.
- Add visual screenshots for the context diagram Widget IR stories if needed for review.

### Code review instructions
- Review `WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx` first to understand expected renderer output.
- Then review `ir.ts` and `WidgetRenderer.tsx` context diagram additions.
- Validate with the same package and Go commands listed in `What worked`.

### Technical details
- New Storybook subgroup: `Widget IR/Renderer/Context Diagrams`.
- The over-budget story uses a modified fixture with a lower token limit to force warning/over-budget behavior.
