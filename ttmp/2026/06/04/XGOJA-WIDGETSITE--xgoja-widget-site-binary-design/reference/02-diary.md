# Diary

## Goal

This diary records the work to create the `XGOJA-WIDGETSITE` ticket, read the requested xgoja help pages, inspect xgoja/go-go-goja/RAG sources, run a ticket-local experiment, write the implementation guide and research logbook, validate the ticket, upload the bundle to reMarkable, and commit the resulting ticket materials.

## Step 1: Create Ticket and Capture xgoja Help

This step established a fresh docmgr ticket for the xgoja WidgetRenderer binary design and captured the requested `xgoja` help output into ticket-local source files. The purpose was to keep the research reproducible rather than relying on transient terminal output.

The ticket is explicitly a research/design ticket. The implementation may require provider work in the RAG repo and possibly changes to xgoja host services or Express asset serving, but this step did not modify those systems.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):**

> read xgoja help --all and in particular tutorial-http-serve-jsverbs and potentially tutorial-generated-runtime-package and tutorial-static-assets-http-server
>
> And create a new ticket and a detailed analysis and research guide where you figure out how to make a xgoja binary with the widget.dsl, the embedded assets, and the express + db service, and make a little webapp with a jsverb.
>
> This is not an easy task, and it might require modifying the host services or embedded asset provider part of xgoja itself (see go-go-goja/), so think hard and research and think deeply.
>
> Create  a detailed analysis / design / implementation guide that is for a new intern, explaining all the parts of the system needed to understand what it is, with prose paragraphs and bullet point sand pseudocode and diagrams and api references and file references. It should be very clear and technical. Store in the ticket and the nupload to remarkable.

>  - what you didn't find useful

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a new docmgr ticket and produce a deep design guide plus research logbook for generating an xgoja binary that combines RAG `widget.dsl`, embedded frontend assets, Express HTTP serving, database access, and JavaScript verb setup. Read the requested xgoja help pages, inspect go-go-goja/xgoja internals, run ticket-local experiments if useful, upload the final bundle to reMarkable, and commit the ticket artifacts.

**Inferred user intent:** Get a rigorous implementation-ready handoff for a difficult xgoja integration rather than a superficial plan.

**Commit (code):** N/A in this step.

### What I did

- Created ticket `XGOJA-WIDGETSITE`:
  - `docmgr ticket create-ticket --ticket XGOJA-WIDGETSITE --title "xgoja Widget Site Binary Design" --topics goja,frontend,packaging,research,ui-dsl`
- Added docs:
  - `design-doc/01-xgoja-widget-site-binary-analysis-and-implementation-guide.md`
  - `reference/01-research-logbook.md`
  - `reference/02-diary.md`
- Captured help output into `sources/`:
  - `xgoja-help-all.txt`
  - `xgoja-help-tutorial-http-serve-jsverbs.txt`
  - `xgoja-help-tutorial-generated-runtime-package.txt`
  - `xgoja-help-tutorial-static-assets-http-server.txt`

### Why

- The user explicitly requested a new ticket, research guide, logbook, diary, reMarkable upload, and commits.
- Capturing help output in `sources/` makes later review possible even if the installed `xgoja` help changes.

### What worked

- Ticket and document creation succeeded.
- `xgoja` was available at `/home/manuel/.local/bin/xgoja`.
- The requested help pages were captured successfully.

### What didn't work

- No failures in this step.

### What I learned

- The xgoja help index already advertises the three main modes needed for this design: static assets, HTTP jsverb serve, and generated runtime package.

### What was tricky to build

- The prompt requested both design documentation and practical experiments. I set up the ticket so experiments live under `scripts/` and command output lives under `sources/`, keeping generated artifacts separate from design prose.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm `XGOJA-WIDGETSITE` is the desired ticket name and whether this should later split into an implementation ticket.

### What should be done in the future

- Use this ticket as the design source before adding provider code under `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite`.

### Code review instructions

- Review the generated ticket workspace and captured source files.
- Validate orientation with `docmgr doc list --ticket XGOJA-WIDGETSITE`.

### Technical details

- Ticket path: `ttmp/2026/06/04/XGOJA-WIDGETSITE--xgoja-widget-site-binary-design`
- Help capture command pattern: `xgoja help <topic> > sources/<topic>.txt`

## Step 2: Inspect xgoja, Providers, RAG Widgets, and Run Experiments

This step gathered the implementation evidence needed for the design. The research focused on three boundaries: xgoja generated build mechanics, go-go-goja provider/host-service capabilities, and the RAG WidgetRenderer packages that would be exposed through xgoja.

The most important result was a concrete failure from a ticket-local provider experiment. The spec could validate, but generated builds could not import a provider stored under `ttmp/.../scripts`. That failure clarified the recommended design: the actual provider must live under a stable module path such as `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite`, and local xgoja builds must use both `--xgoja-replace` and `packages[].replace`.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 1)

**Assistant interpretation:** Research deeply enough to determine what can be done with xgoja today and what might require provider or host-service changes.

**Inferred user intent:** Avoid an implementation plan that ignores generated module import semantics, host-service lifecycle, or static asset limitations.

**Commit (code):** N/A in this step.

### What I did

- Read upstream xgoja and go-go-goja sources:
  - `go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/providers/http/serve.go`
  - `go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/providers/http/http.go`
  - `go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/providers/host/host.go`
  - `go-go-goja/modules/express/express.go`
  - `go-go-goja/modules/database/database.go`
  - `go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/providerapi/capabilities.go`
  - `go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/app/assets.go`
  - `go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/app/host_services.go`
  - `go-go-goja/cmd/xgoja/internal/generate/gomod.go`
- Read xgoja docs:
  - `cmd/xgoja/doc/04-tutorial-providing-package-and-modules.md`
  - `cmd/xgoja/doc/06-buildspec-reference.md`
  - `cmd/xgoja/doc/11-provider-runtime-config-and-host-services.md`
- Read RAG WidgetRenderer sources:
  - `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site`
  - current WIDGETSITE diary/design material from the previous implementation work
- Ran upstream example smoke targets:
  - `make -C examples/xgoja/10-embedded-assets-fs serve-smoke`
  - `make -C examples/xgoja/13-http-serve-jsverbs smoke`
- Attempted the generated-runtime-package example smoke:
  - `make -C examples/xgoja/14-generated-runtime-package smoke`
- Created ticket-local experiment:
  - `scripts/01-current-xgoja-widgetsite-experiment/xgoja.yaml`
  - `scripts/01-current-xgoja-widgetsite-experiment/widgetprovider/provider.go`
  - `scripts/01-current-xgoja-widgetsite-experiment/verbs/sites.js`
  - `scripts/01-current-xgoja-widgetsite-experiment/assets/public/index.html`
- Ran experiment commands and captured output:
  - `xgoja doctor -f xgoja.yaml`
  - `xgoja list-modules -f xgoja.yaml`
  - `xgoja build -f xgoja.yaml --keep-work`
  - `xgoja build -f xgoja.yaml --xgoja-replace /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-05-27/rag-evaluation-system/go-go-goja --keep-work`

### Why

- The target binary combines multiple xgoja features. Reading tutorials alone was not enough to know how those features compose.
- The user explicitly warned that host services or embedded asset provider behavior might need changes.
- Running experiments helps distinguish design assumptions from current tool behavior.

### What worked

- `xgoja doctor` passed for the combined ticket-local spec.
- `xgoja list-modules` showed the intended module set:
  - `express`
  - `fs:assets`
  - `db`
  - `widget.dsl`
- Upstream example 10 and 13 smoke targets completed successfully.
- The host provider already exposes both embedded fs and db modules.
- The database module already supports `WithPreconfiguredDB`, which is useful for future host-service database wiring.

### What didn't work

- Running the first experiment build without `--xgoja-replace` failed:

```text
Error: go mod tidy failed: exit status 1
go: downloading github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja v0.0.0
go: example.com/generated/xgoja-widgetsite-experiment imports
	github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/pkg/xgoja/app: reading github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/go.mod at revision v0.0.0: unknown revision v0.0.0
```

- This is expected when the installed/source-built `xgoja` cannot infer a released go-go-goja module version.
- Running the build with `--xgoja-replace` failed differently:

```text
Error: go mod tidy failed: exit status 1
go: module /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-05-27/rag-evaluation-system/go-go-goja requires go >= 1.26.1; switching to go1.26.4

go: example.com/generated/xgoja-widgetsite-experiment imports

	ERROR: Repository not found.
	fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
```

- The generated-runtime-package help page referenced an absent example:

```text
make: *** examples/xgoja/14-generated-runtime-package: No such file or directory.  Stop.
```

### What I learned

- xgoja generated builds run in their own temporary Go module. They do not inherit the developer's current module or `go.work` by default.
- `--xgoja-replace` solves local go-go-goja development, but downstream providers also need `packages[].replace`.
- `packages[].replace` works best when provider imports live under a normal module root, because `providerModulePath` trims imports at `/pkg/`, `/cmd/`, or `/internal/`.
- A provider under `ttmp/.../scripts` is useful as a shape experiment but not as an implementation location.

### What was tricky to build

- The experiment intentionally crossed module boundaries: generated xgoja module, local go-go-goja checkout, local RAG module, and a ticket scratch provider. The failure exposed import-resolution rules that would otherwise be easy to miss.
- The existing db module can be used immediately with `allowConfigure: true`, but a production-quality preconfigured DB service needs provider capability wiring so CLI/config/env values decide the DSN and read/write policy before JavaScript executes.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review whether the first implementation should add only `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite`, or also extend the host provider database service path immediately.
- Review whether Express should get a dedicated `spaFromAssetsModule` helper for the React app.
- Review the absent `examples/xgoja/14-generated-runtime-package` reference before relying on package mode docs.

### What should be done in the future

- Implement a real provider under `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite`.
- Move the experiment into `examples/xgoja/widget-site` once provider code exists.
- Add a combined upstream-style smoke target.

### Code review instructions

- Start with the ticket experiment under `scripts/01-current-xgoja-widgetsite-experiment`.
- Review captured command outputs under `sources/experiment-*.txt`.
- Review `cmd/xgoja/internal/generate/gomod.go` for generated module replacement behavior.

### Technical details

- Current working experiment path: `ttmp/2026/06/04/XGOJA-WIDGETSITE--xgoja-widget-site-binary-design/scripts/01-current-xgoja-widgetsite-experiment`
- Expected future provider path: `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite`
- Required local build flag for go-go-goja: `--xgoja-replace /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-05-27/rag-evaluation-system/go-go-goja`
- Required local provider spec field: `packages[].replace: <repo-root>`

## Step 3: Write Design Guide and Research Logbook

This step converted the gathered evidence into two long-form ticket documents. The design guide is written as an implementation-ready handoff for a new intern, and the research logbook records each resource's usefulness and stale points.

The design intentionally recommends a staged implementation. First, add a normal RAG xgoja provider and prove a tiny webapp with embedded assets, Express, db, and `widget.dsl`. Then replace the tiny app with the built WidgetRenderer React app and add browser smoke. This sequencing avoids mixing React packaging failures with xgoja provider/import failures.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 1)

**Assistant interpretation:** Produce the requested detailed guide and logbook after evidence gathering.

**Inferred user intent:** Leave behind a document that an intern can use to implement the binary safely and understand the underlying xgoja machinery.

**Commit (code):** N/A in this step.

### What I did

- Wrote `design-doc/01-xgoja-widget-site-binary-analysis-and-implementation-guide.md`.
- Wrote `reference/01-research-logbook.md`.
- Updated this diary.
- The design guide includes:
  - executive summary
  - problem statement
  - current evidence
  - target architecture diagram
  - proposed `xgoja.yaml`
  - provider package design
  - JavaScript verb design
  - frontend asset strategy
  - database strategy
  - generated runtime package discussion
  - experiment results
  - implementation plan
  - possible xgoja changes
  - decision records
  - intern checklist
  - validation commands
  - risks and review points
- The research logbook includes entries for help pages, docs, source files, examples, RAG widget packages, and the ticket experiment.

### Why

- The user requested detailed intern-facing design documentation with prose, bullets, pseudocode, diagrams, API references, and file references.
- The design needed to distinguish what works today from what should be implemented later.

### What worked

- The final design is evidence-backed and includes the ticket experiment's actual failure output.
- The logbook records the out-of-date generated-runtime-package example reference.
- The guide explains why provider code should live under `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite` rather than `ttmp`.

### What didn't work

- No writing failures in this step.

### What I learned

- The xgoja provider model is strong enough for the first binary if provider package location and replacements are handled correctly.
- The likely xgoja changes are polish/hardening items: DB host-service preconfiguration and assets-backed SPA fallback.

### What was tricky to build

- The design had to avoid overclaiming. The ticket experiment did not produce a runnable binary because the provider location was intentionally scratch-local. The guide states this clearly and uses it as evidence for the real provider path.
- The generated runtime package mode is relevant but not primary. The guide explains it as a fallback for host-owned lifecycle rather than mixing it into the first jsverb binary plan.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review the proposed provider package API and package id `rag-widget-site`.
- Review the database strategy and whether `allowConfigure: true` is acceptable for the first demo.
- Review the recommendation to add `spaFromAssetsModule` later rather than immediately.

### What should be done in the future

- Implement Phase 1 and Phase 2 from the design guide.
- Add CI or Makefile smoke once the generated xgoja example exists.

### Code review instructions

- Start with the design guide's `Executive Summary`, `Target Architecture`, and `Required Implementation Plan` sections.
- Then review the research logbook entries 8 through 14 for source-code evidence.

### Technical details

- Primary design doc: `design-doc/01-xgoja-widget-site-binary-analysis-and-implementation-guide.md`
- Research logbook: `reference/01-research-logbook.md`

## Step 4: Validate, Upload, and Prepare Commit

This step validated the ticket with docmgr and uploaded the final bundle to reMarkable. The first upload succeeded but reported a Mermaid rendering warning, so I corrected the diagram syntax and uploaded the bundle again with `--force` to ensure the reMarkable PDF contains the clean diagram.

The resulting bundle contains the design guide, research logbook, and diary. The ticket is now ready to commit as a documentation and research artifact.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 1)

**Assistant interpretation:** Finish the ticket deliverable, upload it to reMarkable, and commit the resulting ticket files.

**Inferred user intent:** Leave the research/design package in a durable state outside the chat transcript.

**Commit (code):** Pending in this step.

### What I did

- Related key source files and experiment artifacts to the design guide, logbook, and diary.
- Updated the ticket changelog.
- Ran `docmgr doctor --ticket XGOJA-WIDGETSITE --stale-after 30`.
- Uploaded the bundle to `/ai/2026/06/05/XGOJA-WIDGETSITE`.
- Fixed Mermaid diagram labels that contained `require("...")` syntax.
- Re-uploaded the corrected bundle with `--force`.

### Why

- The ticket needs docmgr relationships and doctor validation before it is a reliable handoff artifact.
- The user explicitly requested upload to reMarkable.
- The first upload warning indicated that the diagram would not render cleanly, so the document needed a fix before final handoff.

### What worked

- `docmgr doctor` passed.
- Final reMarkable upload succeeded:

```text
OK: uploaded XGOJA-WIDGETSITE Widget Site Binary Design.pdf -> /ai/2026/06/05/XGOJA-WIDGETSITE
```

### What didn't work

- The first upload emitted a Mermaid parse warning:

```text
WARNING: failed to render Mermaid block 1: mmdc failed: Generating single mermaid chart
Error: Parse error on line 15:
...--> FSAssets[require("fs:assets")]    H
-----------------------^
```

- Root cause: Mermaid did not accept the unquoted node labels containing `require("fs:assets")` and similar strings.
- Fix: changed those labels to quoted labels such as `FSAssets["require('fs:assets')"]` and re-uploaded.

### What I learned

- Mermaid labels containing parentheses and quotes should be written as quoted node labels to survive PDF rendering.
- reMarkable upload can succeed while still warning that a diagram rendered poorly, so warnings need review before final handoff.

### What was tricky to build

- The upload was successful despite the warning, which could have hidden the bad diagram in the PDF. I treated the warning as a document quality issue and fixed it before considering the upload done.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review the final design guide diagram rendering in the uploaded PDF if visual fidelity is important.

### What should be done in the future

- Prefer Mermaid labels with single quotes inside double-quoted node labels when the text contains function calls or module names.

### Code review instructions

- Review the final diff for the XGOJA-WIDGETSITE ticket only.
- Confirm no unrelated main-repo implementation files are staged in the commit.

### Technical details

- reMarkable destination: `/ai/2026/06/05/XGOJA-WIDGETSITE`
- Bundle name: `XGOJA-WIDGETSITE Widget Site Binary Design`


## Step 5: Implement the First xgoja Widget Site Slice

This step turned the earlier design into the first working implementation slice. The RAG repository now has a stable xgoja provider package that exposes the existing `widget.dsl` module through generated xgoja binaries, plus a tiny generated-binary example that combines Express, embedded assets, the database host module, JavaScript verbs, and Widget IR output.

The implementation intentionally keeps the webapp small. It proves the hard integration path first: generated xgoja module resolution, local `packages[].replace`, `--xgoja-replace`, embedded static files, `db.configure()`, and curl-visible Widget IR endpoints. Replacing the tiny page with the packaged React WidgetRenderer app can happen in the next slice without changing the provider boundary.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "go ahead"

**Assistant interpretation:** Implement the planned first slice from the xgoja design: add the real RAG xgoja provider for `widget.dsl` / `rag.dsl`, create a generated binary example and smoke test, validate it, update the ticket diary, and commit.

**Inferred user intent:** Move from research/design into a concrete, buildable xgoja integration while keeping the scope small enough to validate reliably.

**Commit (code):** 70f30b1f53a5ed6530b1780431ee2b3bceddcd91 — "Add xgoja widget site provider and example"

### What I did

- Updated the existing Widget DSL engine integration for the current go-go-goja API:
  - `github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/engine` -> `github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/pkg/engine`
  - `engine.NewBuilder()` -> `engine.NewRuntimeFactoryBuilder()`
  - `RuntimeModuleSpec` -> `RuntimeModuleRegistrar`
  - `RuntimeModuleContext` -> `RuntimeModuleRegistrationContext`
  - `engine.Factory` -> `engine.RuntimeFactory`
- Added `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite/provider.go`:
  - package id `rag-widget-site`
  - module `widget.dsl`
  - module alias `rag.dsl`
  - both modules use `widgetdsl.NewLoader()`.
- Added `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite/provider_test.go`:
  - verifies provider registry module resolution for `widget.dsl` and `rag.dsl`
  - verifies a generated-runtime-style host can `require("widget.dsl")` and produce Widget IR.
- Added `examples/xgoja/widget-site/`:
  - `xgoja.yaml` selecting `express`, `fs:assets`, `db`, and `widget.dsl`
  - `verbs/sites.js` exposing `serve sites demo`
  - `assets/public/index.html` as a tiny embedded static app
  - `Makefile` with `doctor`, `list-modules`, `build`, and `serve-smoke`
  - `.gitignore` ignoring generated `dist/` output.
- Checked tasks 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 25 in the ticket.
- Related the new provider and example files to this diary and updated the ticket changelog.

### Why

- The earlier experiment proved that ticket-local providers are not generated-build-safe. A real provider needed to live under a stable package path in the RAG module.
- The generated example needed to exercise the real composition path rather than only unit-test the provider.
- The first implementation slice should avoid adding xgoja host-service changes until the basic provider/assets/db/jsverb path is known to work.

### What worked

- Focused package tests passed:

```text
go test ./pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/widgetrunner ./pkg/widgetserver -count=1
```

- The xgoja example smoke passed:

```text
make -C examples/xgoja/widget-site smoke
```

- The smoke ran:
  - `xgoja doctor -f examples/xgoja/widget-site/xgoja.yaml`
  - `xgoja list-modules -f examples/xgoja/widget-site/xgoja.yaml`
  - `xgoja build ... --xgoja-replace /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-05-27/rag-evaluation-system/go-go-goja --keep-work`
  - generated binary `serve sites demo --http-listen 127.0.0.1:18791`
  - curl checks for `/healthz`, `/static/`, and `/api/widget/pages/demo`.
- `xgoja list-modules` showed the desired module aliases:
  - `express`
  - `fs:assets`
  - `db`
  - `widget.dsl`.

### What didn't work

- A full workspace test still fails outside the focused implementation packages because the active workspace includes sibling `scraper`, and `scraper/pkg/js/runtime/databases.go` still imports the old go-go-goja path:

```text
go test ./... -count=1
# github.com/go-go-golems/rag-evaluation-system/cmd/rag-eval
../scraper/pkg/js/runtime/databases.go:7:2: no required module provides package github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/engine; to add it:
	cd /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-05-27/rag-evaluation-system/scraper
	go get github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/engine
```

- `GOWORK=off go test ./... -count=1` also cannot be used as a clean validation right now because the published `github.com/go-go-golems/scraper v0.0.2` transitively imports `github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/engine`, while released `go-go-goja v0.8.0` exposes the engine API under `pkg/engine`.
- A temporary `GOWORK=off -mod=mod` provider probe introduced broad `go.mod` / `go.sum` churn; I reverted those files to avoid committing dependency noise unrelated to this slice.

### What I learned

- The current go-go-goja engine API rename affects both direct Widget DSL tests and runner composition; the RAG package must use `pkg/engine` and the new runtime factory builder names.
- A stable xgoja provider package under `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite` works with generated xgoja builds when `packages[].replace` points back to the RAG module root.
- For the first demo, `db.configure("sqlite3", ":memory:")` is sufficient and avoids host-service changes. A preconfigured database host-service remains a future production hardening task.

### What was tricky to build

- The generated xgoja binary is built from a temporary Go module, so local development requires two independent replace paths: `--xgoja-replace` for the local go-go-goja checkout and `packages[].replace` for the RAG provider package. Missing either replace can make the build resolve the wrong module source or try to fetch unpublished local code.
- The provider test needed to cover two levels: direct provider registry module resolution and a generated-runtime-style host requiring the module through the xgoja runtime. The second test is more valuable because it exercises the integration shape the generated binary uses.
- Full-repo validation is currently entangled with the sibling/published `scraper` dependency's stale go-go-goja import path. I kept the validation honest by recording the failure verbatim and limiting the pass claim to focused packages plus the xgoja generated-binary smoke.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review `examples/xgoja/widget-site/xgoja.yaml` to confirm the package ids, module aliases, and local `replace` path match xgoja conventions.
- Review `verbs/sites.js` for API shape: it currently returns a `schemaVersion`, `id`, `title`, and `root` directly from the jsverb rather than using `pkg/widgetserver`.
- Review whether task 25 should stay checked as a demo-scope decision (`db.configure()` for now) or be split into a separate production database host-service task.

### What should be done in the future

- Replace the tiny static app with `packages/rag-evaluation-site/app-dist` once the xgoja path is stable.
- Add a Playwright smoke for the generated xgoja binary after the React app is embedded.
- Decide whether xgoja should gain a first-class preconfigured DB host-service contribution for production WidgetRenderer binaries.
- Consider adding an Express helper for SPA fallback from embedded assets.
- Fix or update the sibling/published `scraper` dependency that still imports `github.com/go-go-golems/go-go-goja/engine`.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite/provider.go` and verify that it registers only the intended modules.
- Review `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite/provider_test.go` to see both direct provider registration and runtime `require("widget.dsl")` coverage.
- Review `examples/xgoja/widget-site/xgoja.yaml`, then `examples/xgoja/widget-site/verbs/sites.js`, then `examples/xgoja/widget-site/Makefile`.
- Validate with:

```text
go test ./pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/widgetrunner ./pkg/widgetserver -count=1
make -C examples/xgoja/widget-site smoke
```

### Technical details

- Provider package path: `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite`
- xgoja package id: `rag-widget-site`
- xgoja modules: `widget.dsl`, `rag.dsl`
- Example path: `examples/xgoja/widget-site`
- Demo listen address in smoke: `127.0.0.1:18791`
- Demo endpoints:
  - `GET /healthz`
  - `GET /static/`
  - `GET /api/widget/schema`
  - `GET /api/widget/pages/demo`


## Step 6: Embed the React WidgetRenderer App in the xgoja Example

This step replaced the tiny diagnostic HTML page in the generated xgoja example with the packaged React `RagEvaluationSiteApp`. The generated binary now serves the same React WidgetRenderer client used by the standalone package, while JavaScript verbs still produce Widget IR through `widget.dsl` and serve the API endpoints from Express.

The implementation keeps the app mounted under `/static/` because xgoja's current static handler checks static mounts before dynamic routes. Mounting the app at `/` would shadow `/api/widget/...`; using `/static/` lets the browser app load assets from `/static/assets/...` while continuing to call `/api/widget/pages/{id}`.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 5)

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue from the first xgoja provider/example slice by embedding the real React app and validating the generated binary in a browser.

**Inferred user intent:** Move beyond a curl-only static placeholder and prove the generated xgoja binary can host the actual WidgetRenderer frontend.

**Commit (code):** 36cd6ea98fbc24d9db6d8f1b077c80099b0a3431 — "Embed React app in xgoja widget site example"

### What I did

- Copied `packages/rag-evaluation-site/app-dist` into `examples/xgoja/widget-site/assets/public`.
- Omitted sourcemaps from the embedded example artifact to avoid committing unnecessary generated bulk.
- Stripped the copied JavaScript bundle's `sourceMappingURL` trailer so the embedded example does not reference a missing sourcemap.
- Rewrote Vite asset URLs in `index.html` from `/assets/...` to `/static/assets/...` for the xgoja static mount.
- Added `make -C examples/xgoja/widget-site sync-app` to refresh the embedded React artifact from `app-dist`.
- Updated `verbs/sites.js`:
  - `/` redirects to `/static/?page=demo`
  - `/favicon.ico` returns `204` to avoid a browser console 404
  - `/api/widget/pages/index` and `/api/widget/pages/demo` both return Widget IR through a shared `widgetPage(id)` helper.
- Updated the curl smoke to verify the React index and static asset URL shape.
- Ran a Pi Playwright browser smoke against the generated xgoja binary.
- Checked ticket tasks 23 and 24.

### Why

- The previous tiny page proved embedded assets, but not the actual React WidgetRenderer client.
- The React app defaults to page id `index`; adding an `index` alias keeps the app usable without special query parameters, while `/static/?page=demo` demonstrates explicit page selection.
- The favicon route keeps Playwright console validation clean.

### What worked

- Refreshing the embedded app worked:

```text
make -C examples/xgoja/widget-site sync-app
```

- The generated binary curl smoke still passed:

```text
make -C examples/xgoja/widget-site smoke
```

- Pi Playwright smoke loaded:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:18792/static/?page=demo
```

- Browser validation evidence:
  - page title: `RAG Evaluation Site`
  - marker: `data-rag-page="RagEvaluationSiteApp"`
  - page id: `demo`
  - rendered text included `Fast Growing Trees`, `Arborvitae Spacing`, and `Rows: 2`
  - network requests returned `200 OK` for `/static/`, JS, CSS, and `/api/widget/pages/demo`
  - console messages: `0` errors, `0` warnings
  - screenshot: `xgoja-widgetsite-react-smoke-2026-06-05.png`.

### What didn't work

- The first browser smoke reported one console error:

```text
[ERROR] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) @ http://127.0.0.1:18792/favicon.ico:0
```

- Fix: added `app.get("/favicon.ico", (_req, res) => res.status(204).end())` and rebuilt the generated binary.
- After the fix, Playwright console messages were clean.

### What I learned

- The packaged app can run under `/static/` as long as its built asset URLs are rewritten to match the static mount.
- xgoja's current static mount ordering makes a root-mounted SPA unsafe for this example because static handling would run before dynamic API routes.
- A small favicon route is enough to make browser console validation deterministic for this generated server.

### What was tricky to build

- The app artifact generated by Vite assumes root-relative assets (`/assets/...`), but the xgoja static handler is mounted under `/static`. Rather than changing the package's global Vite config, I added an example-local sync step that copies the built app, removes sourcemap references, and rewrites only the example's embedded index.
- The React app fetches `/api/widget/pages/{pageId}` based on the URL query/path. Since the example is served under `/static/`, using `/static/?page=demo` preserves the static mount while still exercising the `demo` page endpoint.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review whether committing the built React app artifact under `examples/xgoja/widget-site/assets/public` is acceptable, or whether the example should require `sync-app` before build instead.
- Review whether xgoja should add an Express/static helper for SPA fallback and API-safe root mounting.
- Review whether `index` should remain an alias for `demo` or become a distinct landing page.

### What should be done in the future

- Consider building the React app with an explicit `base` option for xgoja examples instead of postprocessing `index.html`.
- Add a committed Playwright script if the repository adopts Playwright as a dev dependency.
- Consider adding xgoja Express support for API-safe SPA fallback from embedded assets.

### Code review instructions

- Review `examples/xgoja/widget-site/Makefile` first to understand the sync/build/smoke workflow.
- Review `examples/xgoja/widget-site/verbs/sites.js` to verify the API and static routes.
- Review `examples/xgoja/widget-site/assets/public/index.html` to confirm it points at `/static/assets/...`.
- Validate with:

```text
make -C examples/xgoja/widget-site sync-app
make -C examples/xgoja/widget-site smoke
```

- Optional browser validation: start `examples/xgoja/widget-site/dist/rag-widget-xgoja-site serve sites demo --http-listen 127.0.0.1:18792` and open `/static/?page=demo`.

### Technical details

- React app source artifact: `packages/rag-evaluation-site/app-dist`
- Embedded xgoja asset root: `examples/xgoja/widget-site/assets/public`
- Browser smoke URL: `http://127.0.0.1:18792/static/?page=demo`
- Screenshot artifact: `xgoja-widgetsite-react-smoke-2026-06-05.png`
