# Diary

## Goal

This diary records the planning-only work for CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ: creating the docmgr ticket, inspecting the existing style-set/context-window Widget IR architecture, writing an intern-facing implementation guide, and publishing the design bundle to reMarkable. No application code was changed in this step.

## Step 1: Create the ticket and write the implementation guide

This step established a dedicated ticket workspace and captured the architecture/design guide before implementation begins. The main output is a detailed guide that explains the existing `styleKey + ContextStyleSet` system, the current context diagram components, the Widget IR/Goja DSL entrypoints, and a phased plan for turning uploaded sessions into colored token-proportional context-window blocks.

The work intentionally stopped at documentation. The requested feature needs a schema decision for uploaded sessions before implementation, especially for turn boundaries, exact token counts, and whether per-turn context-window snapshots are available.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Create a new docmgr ticket (with default root) in order to use the new color style + legend functionality for context window widgets, and update the visualization of the uploaded session to show the content of the context window as colored blocks for the different types of blocks:

system / user / agent / tool call / tool result / file read/write / thinking ... The size of the blocks should be proportional to their token size (up to readability limits). if possible, point out the individual turns (it might not be possible, in which case the design system will need to be updated, point those out). Or maybe make a version where one can page through the individual turns.

Before starting: 

Create  a detailed analysis / design / implementation guide that is for a new intern, explaining all the parts of the system needed to understand what it is, with prose paragraphs and bullet point sand pseudocode and diagrams and api references and file references. It should be very clear and technical. Store in the ticket and the nupload to remarkable.

Add ASCII screenshots / renderings of what the widgets would look like.

Keep a diary as you work.

Don't start the actual work."

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a new docmgr ticket under the repository default `ttmp` root, investigate the existing context-window style-set and Widget IR architecture, write a detailed implementation guide with ASCII renderings and file references, keep a diary, and upload the resulting documentation bundle to reMarkable without touching production feature code.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants a high-quality design handoff for a future implementer/intern before coding begins, with enough source-backed context to avoid breaking the recently added palette/legend architecture.

**Commit (code):** N/A — no code changes were made.

### What I did

- Ran `docmgr status --summary-only` to confirm the default docs root.
- Created ticket `CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ` with title `Context Window Block Visualization With Style Sets`.
- Added a design doc: `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/design-doc/01-design-and-implementation-guide.md`.
- Added this diary: `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/reference/01-investigation-diary.md`.
- Added ticket tasks for guide writing, source-file relations, validation, and reMarkable upload.
- Inspected the existing architecture with repository searches and line-numbered source reads:
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/types.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/styles.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/ContextStripDiagram/ContextStripDiagram.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/ContextStackDiagram/ContextStackDiagram.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/ContextTreemap/ContextTreemap.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/ContextDiagramPanel/ContextDiagramPanel.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/ir.ts`
  - `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go`
  - `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite/provider.go`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/ContextUploadDropArea/ContextUploadDropArea.tsx`
- Wrote the design guide with:
  - executive summary,
  - problem statement and scope,
  - architecture overview,
  - source-backed file references,
  - proposed uploaded-session normalization model,
  - style-set vocabulary,
  - Widget IR/Goja DSL pseudocode,
  - ASCII renderings,
  - phased implementation plan,
  - design-system gaps,
  - decision records,
  - testing strategy and handoff checklist.

### Why

- The user explicitly asked for design and analysis before starting implementation.
- The feature depends on uploaded-session schema details that are not yet documented, so a safe plan needs to separate existing UI capabilities from missing runtime data.
- The style-set system is intentionally generic; future code should preserve `styleKey + ContextStyleSet` rather than creating another hardcoded enum.

### What worked

- `docmgr ticket create-ticket` created the workspace under the repository default root.
- The existing source architecture already supports most of the desired rendering through `ContextWindowPart`, `ContextStyleSet`, `ContextDiagramPanel`, Widget IR props, and Goja DSL helpers.
- Existing Storybook examples already include a content-block-style snapshot with system/user/tool/result/answer blocks, which made the proposed implementation path concrete.
- The design guide could point to exact code locations for proportional sizing and readability floors.

### What didn't work

- One broad search command exited with code 2 because it included a path that was not available from the current repository root:

```bash
rg -n "Context(Window|Budget|Strip|Stack|Treemap|Diagram)|styleSet|styleKey|ContextStyle|transcript|turn|tool|file|thinking|message|trace|session|upload|tokens" packages/rag-evaluation-site/src pkg internal ClubMedMeetup -S
```

- The output still yielded useful results for existing paths, but the command return code indicated a search-path issue.
- I did not find an implementation-level uploaded-session parser during this planning pass. The visible upload component is presentational (`ContextUploadDropArea`) and the exact uploaded session schema remains an open question.

### What I learned

- The new style-set system is already the right abstraction for uploaded-session block categories; the gap is session normalization, not palette rendering.
- `ContextStripDiagram`, `ContextStackDiagram`, and `ContextTreemap` already implement token-proportional rendering with readability floors.
- Turn-level visualization is data-dependent. If the uploaded session does not record reliable turn boundaries or per-turn context-window membership, the design system can only approximate turn labels or needs runtime/schema support.
- `ContextDiagramPanel` already has selected-part detail rendering that can show content previews and metadata, which is useful for file read/write and tool result inspection.

### What was tricky to build

- The user asked for a future visualization of an "uploaded session", but the source schema for that session is not yet identified in the visible code. The guide had to avoid pretending that turn paging or exact token accounting is guaranteed.
- There are two overlapping but distinct concepts: a transcript and the actual model context window. A transcript can be transformed into approximate blocks, but exact context-window membership requires runtime data about compaction, evictions, summaries, and injected system/tool state.
- The category "thinking" needs careful wording. The design guide treats it as explicit scratchpad/generated notes only, not hidden chain-of-thought inference.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm the real uploaded session schema before implementation.
- Confirm whether token counts are present, estimated, or should be computed with a tokenizer.
- Confirm whether turn paging should show cumulative approximate snapshots or only exact runtime-provided snapshots.
- Review the proposed block vocabulary (`system`, `user`, `agent`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `file_read`, `file_write`, `thinking`, etc.) against real uploaded data.

### What should be done in the future

- Add representative uploaded session JSON samples to the ticket `sources/` directory if they are safe to store.
- Decide whether the normalizer should live in the frontend package, backend host app, or a shared package.
- Implement only after the design guide has been reviewed.
- If turn boundaries are required visually, prototype either `ContextTurnPagerPanel` or `ContextGroupedStripDiagram` in Storybook before integrating runtime uploads.

### Code review instructions

- There is no production code to review in this step.
- Review the design guide first:
  - `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/design-doc/01-design-and-implementation-guide.md`
- Validate that file references match the current architecture and that the proposed phased plan does not introduce implementation before schema confirmation.
- After reMarkable upload, verify that the uploaded PDF includes the design guide and diary.

### Technical details

Commands run:

```bash
docmgr status --summary-only
docmgr ticket create-ticket --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --title "Context Window Block Visualization With Style Sets" --topics frontend,visualization,context-window,storybook,widget-ir
docmgr doc add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --doc-type design-doc --title "Design and Implementation Guide"
docmgr doc add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --doc-type reference --title "Investigation Diary"
docmgr task add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --text "Write intern-facing architecture and implementation guide before code changes"
docmgr task add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --text "Relate source files that define style sets, context snapshots, Widget IR, and DSL entrypoints"
docmgr task add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --text "Validate ticket hygiene with docmgr doctor"
docmgr task add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --text "Upload design bundle to reMarkable"
```

Key source facts captured in the design guide:

- `ContextWindowPart` carries `styleKey`, `tokens`, content preview/content, token offsets, and metadata.
- `ContextStyleSet` carries caller-defined styles and legend items.
- `ContextDiagramPanel` can switch between strip, stack, budget, and treemap views.
- Goja DSL helpers can emit visual styles, legend items, style sets, context parts, context snapshots, and context diagram recipe nodes.

## Step 2: Validate and upload the design bundle

This step completed the documentation delivery loop. After the guide and diary were written, I related the source files that shaped the design, ran `docmgr doctor`, and uploaded a bundled PDF to reMarkable after a dry run.

The upload makes the planning package reviewable away from the terminal. It includes the ticket index, the design guide, the diary, tasks, and changelog.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 1)

**Assistant interpretation:** Complete docmgr bookkeeping, validate the ticket, and upload the resulting design bundle to reMarkable while still avoiding feature implementation.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the intern-facing design package available in both the repository ticket and on reMarkable for reading/review.

**Commit (code):** N/A — no code changes were made.

### What I did

- Related the design doc to the key source files inspected during analysis.
- Related the diary to the design doc and the most important source files.
- Checked completed tasks for guide writing, file relations, and validation.
- Ran `docmgr doctor --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --stale-after 30`.
- Verified `remarquee status` and `remarquee cloud account --non-interactive`.
- Ran a dry-run bundle upload to `/ai/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ`.
- Uploaded the real PDF bundle to `/ai/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ`.
- Verified the remote listing contains `CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ Design Guide`.

### Why

- The ticket-research workflow requires source-file relations, validation, and dry-run-before-real-upload delivery.
- The reMarkable upload should include enough context for offline review, not just the design doc alone.

### What worked

- `docmgr doctor` reported all checks passed.
- `remarquee status` returned `remarquee: ok`.
- The reMarkable account check returned `user=wesen@ruinwesen.com sync_version=1.5`.
- Dry-run upload showed the expected bundle contents.
- Real upload succeeded and `remarquee cloud ls` showed the uploaded bundle.

### What didn't work

- N/A.

### What I learned

- The generated bundle flow is suitable for design packages because it can combine index, guide, diary, tasks, and changelog into one PDF with a table of contents.

### What was tricky to build

- The main sequencing constraint was to validate and dry-run before real upload. This avoids sending malformed or incomplete PDFs to the reMarkable destination.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm that the uploaded PDF renders the large ASCII diagrams and pseudocode blocks clearly on the reMarkable screen.
- Confirm that the bundle contents are the desired scope; a later upload could include source snippets if needed.

### What should be done in the future

- If the design changes after schema review, upload a revised bundle rather than editing the already-uploaded PDF in place.

### Code review instructions

- Review the final docmgr artifacts in the ticket workspace.
- Verify reMarkable path `/ai/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ` contains `CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ Design Guide`.

## Step 3: Remove live/course session shell from the active workspace surface

This step changed the active session workspace surface so it no longer presents the live/course-style navigation model. The visible shell now stays focused on the requested flow: upload a session, visualize its context/window blocks, and inspect the transcript.

I committed the cleanup in two small intervals: first limiting the default shell navigation, then replacing the Storybook course/handout surface with Upload / Visualize / Transcript examples. This keeps the reusable lower-level course widgets in the library for now, but removes them from the session workspace presentation path.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "remove the new live session view part of the code, and keep it at upload + visualize/transcript.

commit at appropriate intervals, and keep a frequent diary."

**Assistant interpretation:** Remove the newly exposed live/course-style session view from the user-facing workspace surface, preserve only Upload, Visualize, and Transcript as the intended workflow, commit focused changes as they complete, and update the diary frequently.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the scope tightened before further implementation so the UI does not imply a live-session/course presentation mode; the product should remain an uploaded-session analysis workflow.

**Commit (code):** 560864d — "Frontend: limit session shell nav"

**Commit (code):** 2edac8e — "Storybook: focus session workspace stories"

### What I did

- Updated `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/courseStudioNav.ts` so the exported default sections contain only:
  - Upload
  - Visualize
  - Transcript
- Updated `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/CourseStudioShell.stories.tsx` so examples default to `visualize` instead of `slides` and use session-workspace footer text.
- Rewrote `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.course-handout.stories.tsx` into a session workspace story module:
  - renamed the Storybook title from `Widget IR/Renderer/Course Studio` to `Widget IR/Renderer/Session Workspace`,
  - removed course landing, slide composition, handout, and course+handout split-view story exports,
  - added `UploadWorkspace`, `VisualizeWorkspace`, and `TranscriptWorkspace`,
  - kept palette controls on the visualize/transcript examples.
- Ran `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck` after each code interval.

### Why

- The live/course shell and course/handout stories made the workspace look like a live workshop/session product instead of an uploaded-session analysis tool.
- The requested product scope is upload plus visualization/transcript inspection.
- Keeping the reusable widgets but removing them from the workspace surface is a smaller, safer cut than deleting library components and DSL exports that may still be useful elsewhere.

### What worked

- TypeScript passed after limiting the navigation.
- TypeScript passed after replacing the Storybook surface.
- The commits stayed focused:
  - one for the default shell nav,
  - one for Storybook/session workspace scope.

### What didn't work

- Searching for a literal `LiveSession`, `live-session`, or `Live Session` symbol did not find a matching code symbol in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`. The live-session concept was represented indirectly by course/slides/handout navigation and stories rather than a literal component name.
- A broad workspace search also surfaced a sibling `go-minitrace` app, which has session/transcript screens, but the active repository work stayed in `2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system` because the current task and ticket are in this package.

### What I learned

- The scope boundary is mostly presentation-level right now. The library still includes course/slide/handout widgets, but the session workspace no longer advertises those as the active flow.
- Storybook names and story exports matter because they are effectively product surfaces for reviewers.

### What was tricky to build

- The phrase "live session view" did not map to an exact symbol. I resolved this by removing the course/slides/handout presentation surfaces while preserving upload, visualize, and transcript paths.
- The package has reusable course widgets and a course DSL. Deleting those immediately would be a broader API-breaking change than the prompt required, so I limited this step to the workspace navigation and Storybook surface.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm whether the reusable `CourseLessonPanel`, `CourseSlidePanel`, `HandoutDocumentShell`, and `course.dsl` exports should remain available as package/library examples, or whether the user wants those deleted in a later hard-removal pass.
- Confirm whether package docs should also be renamed away from "Course Studio" now that the active workspace surface is upload/visualize/transcript.

### What should be done in the future

- If the product should remove the course/handout API entirely, do that as a separate explicit breaking-change step with schema/DSL/docs/test updates.
- Consider renaming `CourseStudioShell` if the component is now intended to be a generic session workspace shell rather than a course shell.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/courseStudioNav.ts` to verify the default navigation has only Upload, Visualize, and Transcript.
- Then review `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.course-handout.stories.tsx` to verify the Storybook surface no longer exposes course landing/slides/handouts.
- Validate with:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
```

### Technical details

Validation commands:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
```

Search commands used during orientation:

```bash
rg -n "LiveSession|live session|live-session|Live Session|session view|SessionView|active session|realtime|real-time" packages/rag-evaluation-site/src pkg internal cmd .github --glob '!node_modules/**' --glob '!dist/**' --glob '!storybook-static/**' -S
rg -n "CourseLessonLanding|CourseSlide|TeachingSlide|Handout|CoursePlusHandout|course|slides|comments|handout|Present|Take-home|Workshop|Course Studio|live session|Live on a real session" packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context packages/rag-evaluation-site/README.md packages/rag-evaluation-site/GUIDELINES.md -S
```

## Step 4: Ground the design in go-minitrace schema and DSL outputs

This step corrected the design assumptions before further cleanup. The earlier guide treated uploaded JSON as a mostly arbitrary source format. The actual integration uses go-minitrace and minitracejs, so the right input to the widgets is the normalized minitrace session schema and DSL query/view rows.

The guide now explains session metadata, ordered turns, tool calls, per-turn token usage, transcript rows, timeline rows, token usage rows, and turn frames. It also adds precise mappings from minitrace rows to transcript messages and context-window parts, including file read/write detection from normalized tool `operation_type` values.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "it could be that the docs are not precise enough and need to be expanded, in cas eyou find things that are unclear. 

But yes, first update the design documentation with th eminitrace schema and mapping updates, then restore the stuff you removed, then remove only the litellm-live-service.js.

Before you start working on that, add phases + for each phase, a detailed list oif tasks to the ticket. then implement them in sequence, committing at appropriate intervals, keeping a freqeunt diary.

Once you are done with all the cleanup, add phases and tasks for the widget improvements, then implement them, making sure to adhere to the proper guidelines. Start with what can be done entirely on the clubmeetup/minitrace-viz side, then to the changes that rqeuire upstream schanges in 2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/ and the goja DSL. Make sure to adhere to the @2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/GUIDELINES.md  and the style of the react design system, the structure of it is really at the heart of the whole system."

**Assistant interpretation:** Add phased ticket tasks first, then update the design guide with concrete minitrace schema/DSL mappings before touching code. After that, restore my over-broad removals and remove only the LiteLLM live service.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the work sequenced carefully, with the design grounded in actual go-minitrace data contracts and with any unclear documentation gaps surfaced instead of guessed around.

**Commit (code):** N/A — documentation interval before code cleanup.

### What I did

- Replaced `tasks.md` with phased task groups covering recovery, minitrace mapping design, ClubMeetup/minitrace-viz local improvements, upstream widget package changes, DSL/schema support, and final validation.
- Read go-minitrace schema and DSL references:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/doc/minitrace-schema.md`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/doc/js-api-reference.md`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/minitracejs/query_view_session.go`
- Added a new `go-minitrace Data Contract for Uploaded Sessions` section to the design guide.
- Documented concrete output fields for `TranscriptRows`, `TurnRows`, `ToolRows`, `TimelineRows`, `TokenUsageRows`, and `TurnFrames`.
- Added mapping sketches for `TranscriptRow -> TranscriptMessage` and `TranscriptRow + ToolRow -> ContextWindowPart`.
- Added a documentation-gap list for unclear go-minitrace behavior, such as exact context-window membership and tool-call request row availability.

### Why

- The widgets should consume normalized minitrace rows, not re-parse raw uploaded JSON.
- The presence of `operation_type` and per-turn usage data changes the implementation strategy: file read/write and token sizes can be more precise than originally documented.
- The design doc needs to be accurate before cleanup and implementation continue.

### What worked

- The minitrace schema gives enough structure for transcript widgets and context block diagrams.
- `TranscriptRows` already flatten messages, thinking, and optional tool rows into a widget-friendly order.
- `ToolRows` provides normalized operation metadata that can drive `file_read`, `file_write`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, and `tool_error` styles.

### What didn't work

- The docs do not yet appear to answer whether exact model context-window membership is available for every adapter. That remains a documented gap.
- It is also unclear whether `TranscriptRows` should include explicit tool-call request rows, or only result/error rows with command/file fallback text.

### What I learned

- go-minitrace is the correct normalization boundary for uploaded session data.
- Context block conversion should be based on minitrace DSL rows and tool operation types.
- The design-system work can likely start locally in ClubMeetup/minitrace-viz before requiring upstream package or Goja DSL changes.

### What was tricky to build

- The original design had a generic normalizer section. I kept a normalized app-side representation, but reframed it as derived from minitrace rows so the guide remains useful without fighting the existing architecture.
- The word "thinking" needs explicit caveats: minitrace can expose `turns[].thinking` when captured, but the UI must not imply hidden reasoning reconstruction.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm whether the minitrace DSL should add a first-class view that already emits `ContextWindowPart`-ready rows.
- Confirm how LiteLLM live service removal affects the upload/import path, if at all.
- Confirm whether go-minitrace docs should expand `TranscriptRows` field definitions and exact row-kind semantics.

### What should be done in the future

- Expand go-minitrace docs if implementation discovers undocumented row shapes or adapter-specific behavior.
- Consider adding a reusable minitrace-to-widget mapping helper after the local ClubMeetup/minitrace-viz implementation proves stable.

### Code review instructions

- Review the new `go-minitrace Data Contract for Uploaded Sessions` section in the design guide.
- Check that it references minitrace schema/DSL source files and does not invent raw-upload behavior.

### Technical details

Relevant source files:

- `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/doc/minitrace-schema.md`
- `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/doc/js-api-reference.md`
- `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/minitracejs/query_view_session.go`

## Step 5: Restore the over-removed course, slide, and handout surfaces

This step recovered from the earlier misunderstanding. The user clarified that slides and handouts should stay; only the recently added LiteLLM live service should be removed. I restored the course workspace navigation and Storybook course/handout examples from the merge baseline while keeping the new minitrace design documentation.

The recovery was done as a focused commit after a frontend typecheck. This puts the React package back into the expected state before removing the actual live-service code.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 4)

**Assistant interpretation:** Restore the course/slides/handouts work I removed by mistake, then proceed to the narrow LiteLLM live-service cleanup.

**Inferred user intent:** Preserve the workshop/course material and handout surfaces; remove only the real-time LiteLLM service addition.

**Commit (code):** 5cd3fb1 — "Frontend: restore course workspace surfaces"

### What I did

- Restored these files from commit `3a4cc1f`:
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.domain-registry.stories.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/courseStudioNav.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/CourseStudioShell.stories.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.course-handout.stories.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/README.md`
- Ran `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`.
- Committed the restoration as `5cd3fb1`.

### Why

- The previous removal was too broad and conflicted with the clarified product intent.
- Restoring from the merge baseline avoids manually reconstructing course/handout examples and reduces risk.

### What worked

- TypeScript passed after restoring the files.
- The recovery commit was focused and did not undo the new minitrace design documentation.

### What didn't work

- N/A for the recovery itself. The earlier mistake is documented in Step 3.

### What I learned

- The phrase "live session view" referred specifically to `litellm-live-service.js`, not the course/session workspace shell.
- When a requested deletion is ambiguous, locate the exact file/symbol before removing UI surfaces.

### What was tricky to build

- The docs commit that introduced the ticket also included an over-narrow package README change. Restoring specific files from `3a4cc1f` was safer than reverting entire commits because the ticket docs and minitrace mapping updates should remain.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm no course/handout story or nav surface remains unintentionally changed after the restore.

### What should be done in the future

- Continue with the narrow `litellm-live-service.js` removal only.

### Code review instructions

- Review commit `5cd3fb1` to verify it restores course/slides/handouts and does not introduce new behavior.
- Validate with:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
```

## Step 6: Remove LiteLLM live integration and run visual smoke tests

This step completed the Phase 0 cleanup that had been blocked on scope precision: remove the local JavaScript LiteLLM live/realtime service, but keep the course, slides, handouts, upload, transcript, and context-window surfaces. After the cleanup, I treated validation as a visual workflow, not just a typecheck: server smoke, Storybook build, Pi Playwright browser smoke, and css-visual-diff overlay/CSS capture all ran against the restored pages.

The smoke work also found a real upstream React warning in Storybook. `WidgetRenderer` was returning arrays of unkeyed rendered children, which surfaced when the course/handout registry story rendered `CourseStudioShell`; I fixed that by wrapping rendered children in keyed fragments.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "continue and do proper storybook / playwright / css-visual-diff smoke tests, using past tickets or docs for the expected procedure."

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue the cleanup, use the prior visual-quality ticket as the test procedure model, validate both the ClubMed minitrace-viz app and Storybook surfaces in a real browser, and record/fix issues found during smoke testing.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants confidence that the narrow LiteLLM live-service removal did not regress restored course/slides/handouts or the context/transcript visual surfaces.

**Commit (code):** ace0505 — "Tests: add ClubMed visual smoke coverage"; 49fd9fa — "Frontend: remove LiteLLM live service"

### What I did

- Removed the JavaScript live service file:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/litellm-live-service.js`
- Removed direct live-service integration points from:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/server.js`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-pages.js`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/webapp/src/main.tsx`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/test-fixtures/smoke-test.sh`
- Preserved the restored course/slides/handouts pages and their Storybook surfaces.
- Added a ticket-local css-visual-diff script:
  - `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/scripts/01-capture-clubmed-visual-smoke.js`
- Ran package and app validation:
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook`
  - `pnpm --dir webapp typecheck`
  - `scripts/sync-widget-spa.sh`
  - `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make build`
  - `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test`
- Ran Pi Playwright smoke against:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:18787/pages/course`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:18787/pages/upload`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:18787/pages/slides`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:18787/pages/handouts`
  - Storybook `widget-ir-renderer-context-diagrams--custom-three-label-widget-ir`
  - Storybook `widget-ir-renderer-transcript-and-notes--annotated-transcript-with-notes-rail`
  - Storybook `widget-ir-renderer-domain-registry-coverage--course-handout-registry-surface`
- Ran css-visual-diff capture successfully into:
  - `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/sources/visual-smoke/run-20260610-154533`
- Fixed a React key warning surfaced by Playwright in:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.tsx`

### Why

- The user explicitly narrowed cleanup to `litellm-live-service.js` and direct live/realtime integration references.
- Server smoke verifies the uploaded-session APIs still work after removing the old live endpoints.
- Storybook and browser smoke verify that restored course/slides/handouts remain visually reachable and that the context/transcript Storybook surfaces still render.
- css-visual-diff gives durable visual evidence: overlay screenshots, preflight JSON, and computed CSS JSON for each page/story.

### What worked

- Source grep after cleanup found no remaining direct source references to:
  - `litellm-live-service`
  - `live-litellm`
  - `/api/live/litellm`
  - `clear-litellm-live`
  - `refresh-litellm-live`
- Clean server smoke passed after stopping the stale test server:

```text
=== Results: 6 passed, 0 failed ===
```

- RAG package validation passed:

```text
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook
```

- ClubMed webapp/app validation passed:

```text
pnpm --dir webapp typecheck
scripts/sync-widget-spa.sh
GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make build
GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test
```

- Pi Playwright rerun passed with no non-favicon console errors for all seven checked pages/stories.
- css-visual-diff succeeded after script fixes and produced overlays for all seven targets.

### What didn't work

- Initial `make build` failed from Go VCS stamping in the generated temporary xgoja module:

```text
Error: go build -o /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/dist/minitrace-viz . failed: exit status 1
error obtaining VCS status: exit status 128
	Use -buildvcs=false to disable VCS stamping.
```

- Fix: reran xgoja build/test with `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false`.
- My first helper script used an over-broad `pkill -f` pattern and interrupted itself before starting the smoke servers. I restarted without pre-killing by broad pattern.
- The first Playwright smoke found a real React console error:

```text
Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
Check the render method of `CourseStudioShell`.  It was passed a child from WidgetRenderer.
```

- Fix: changed `WidgetRenderer.renderChildren()` to return keyed fragments based on component `key`, `id`, type/tag, and index.
- The first css-visual-diff run failed during summary writing because I used a non-existent `cvd.read.json` helper:

```text
Error: promise rejected: TypeError: Cannot read property 'json' of undefined or null
```

- Fix: tracked missing preflight probes in memory while writing each preflight file.
- The second css-visual-diff run failed because I required a `ContextDiagramPanel` probe on the slides page, but the slide surface renders direct diagram content instead:

```text
Error: promise rejected: Error: Missing required visual probes: clubmed-slides:context-panel
```

- Fix: relaxed the slides probe to require `CourseSlidePanel` only.

### What I learned

- The ClubMed app's normal validation path is `make build`/`make test`, but on this machine xgoja's generated temp module needs `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false` for reliable local builds.
- The prior WIDGETDSL visual-quality ticket provides a good pattern: serve the app and static Storybook, capture overlays and computed CSS JSON with css-visual-diff, and store the script/artifacts under the ticket.
- Browser smoke is useful even when TypeScript/builds pass; it caught the unkeyed children warning in a restored Storybook surface.
- The slides page should be probed by its course-level organism (`CourseSlidePanel`) rather than assuming it wraps content in `ContextDiagramPanel`.

### What was tricky to build

- The tricky scope issue was separating direct LiteLLM live-service references from unrelated course/slides/handout surfaces. I removed the JS service, HTTP routes, page/nav entry, refresh bridge, and smoke checks while preserving the upload/session workflow and course materials.
- The tricky validation issue was stale server state. A first `make test` appeared to pass after a bind error because an old server was still listening on the same port; I stopped the stale smoke server and reran `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test` cleanly.
- The css-visual-diff script needed selectors that match actual rendered surfaces. Over-specific component assumptions created false failures, so I adjusted the script to require semantic page-level organisms and keep overlay targets focused.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review whether the Python `minitrace_viz_litellm/` callback helper and `test-fixtures/litellm-chat-completion.json` should remain as historical/reference material or be removed in a later, explicitly scoped cleanup. I did not remove them in this step because the user asked for the JS live service and direct references only.
- Review the `WidgetRenderer` keyed-fragment fix because it changes the generic Widget IR rendering path, even though it is intended to be a React correctness fix.
- Review generated SPA asset diffs to confirm they only reflect the removed refresh bridge and the rebuilt package dependency.

### What should be done in the future

- Add a small committed wrapper script for starting/stopping the visual smoke servers if this becomes a repeated workflow.
- Decide whether `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false` belongs in the minitrace-viz Makefile or xgoja build command for local generated-module builds.
- If visual smoke artifacts become too large for normal commits, keep only the script and summary, or move screenshots to ignored evidence storage.

### Code review instructions

```

## Step 7: Implement Local Uploaded-Session Context Blocks in minitrace-viz

This step completed the local-first Phase 2 implementation in the ClubMed minitrace-viz app. The uploaded-session visualization now emits block-specific `styleKey` values for user turns, agent responses, thinking/scratchpad text, tool calls, tool results, and file read/write context instead of collapsing everything into generic conversation/tool/result buckets.

The implementation stayed local to minitrace-viz. I did not need upstream React component changes or Goja DSL/schema helpers for this phase because the existing `ContextDiagramPanel`, `ContextWindowPart`, `ContextStyleSet`, Widget IR, and palette DSL were already expressive enough once the app emitted richer session-derived parts.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "do phase 1 - 5, i'm going to run some errands and i expect you to be done when i come back."

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue through the remaining CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ phases, implementing the local widget improvements first, then only upstreaming design-system or DSL changes if the local implementation proves they are required.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the full ticket implementation completed while they are away, with focused commits and enough validation/documentation to review afterward.

**Commit (code):** 58ee4d3 — "Minitrace viz: emit uploaded session context blocks"

### What I did

- Confirmed Phase 1 was already documented and checked in the ticket: minitrace schema, minitracejs row outputs, and mapping tables were already present from the prior design pass.
- Updated `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-pages.js` with a session-specific legend vocabulary:
  - `system`, `user`, `agent`, `thinking`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `file_read`, `file_write`, `summary`, `tool_error`, `active`, `empty`, `other`.
- Updated `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-session-data.js` so context snapshots emit:
  - role-specific message blocks (`user`, `agent`, `system`),
  - `thinking` blocks from reasoning/scratchpad text,
  - small `tool_call` blocks,
  - `tool_result` / `tool_error` status/result blocks,
  - explicit `file_read` / `file_write` blocks derived from minitrace file rows and operation metadata.
- Updated `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/session-service.js` to persist the raw upload as `original-upload.txt` next to the converted minitrace archive.
- Updated `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/timeline-data.js` with a local fallback parser for simple JSONL uploads when go-minitrace conversion yields an empty normalized `turns` table.
- Updated `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/test-fixtures/smoke-test.sh` to assert that uploaded-session context data includes `user`, `agent`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, and `file_read` style keys.

### Why

- The design guide required local-first implementation in ClubMed/minitrace-viz before changing upstream package contracts.
- The existing widget contracts could already render colored, token-proportional blocks as long as the local app emitted precise `styleKey`s and parts.
- The sample fixture converted through go-minitrace but produced zero normalized turns/tools, so the app needed a local fallback to keep uploaded-session demos useful and testable.

### What worked

- Syntax checks passed:

```bash
node --check minitrace-viz/lib/timeline-data.js
node --check minitrace-viz/lib/course-session-data.js
node --check minitrace-viz/lib/session-service.js
```

- Local validation passed on the first attempt:

```bash
pnpm --dir webapp typecheck
scripts/sync-widget-spa.sh
GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test
```

- The smoke test now reports:

```text
=== Results: 7 passed, 0 failed ===
```

- Manual API inspection of the sample upload reported:

```text
turns 6 tools 5
messages 11
style keys: ['agent', 'empty', 'file_read', 'system', 'thinking', 'tool_call', 'tool_result', 'user']
```

### What didn't work

- Before adding the fallback parser, the uploaded sample produced only the system estimate:

```text
style keys: ['empty', 'system']
system system 1200 system + tool policy
```

- Inspecting the converted native minitrace JSON showed why: the importer metadata said conversion succeeded, but the resulting `turns` and `tool_calls` arrays were empty for the sample fixture. The normalized SQL timeline therefore had no rows to map.
- Fix: persist the original upload and use a local JSONL fallback when normalized rows are empty.

### What I learned

- The upstream `ContextDiagramPanel` and current Widget IR contracts are sufficient for the requested block categories; the missing piece was local normalization/classification.
- For realistic uploaded-session demos, preserving the raw upload is valuable even when go-minitrace conversion succeeds nominally, because adapters may still produce an empty normalized session for a lightweight fixture.
- File-context visualization needs to avoid double-counting: when a tool has file rows, file blocks carry most of the file context weight and the tool-result block becomes a small status/result block.

### What was tricky to build

- The tricky part was balancing minitrace-derived rows with a fallback path without changing go-minitrace itself. I kept the fallback inside minitrace-viz and only activate it when normalized `turns` are empty.
- The second tricky part was token accounting for file-heavy tools. A single opaque tool result hides whether the context came from file reads or command output, but naively adding file blocks on top of the full tool result double-counts. The current compromise splits file-heavy outputs into per-file blocks and caps the remaining successful tool-result/status block.
- The selected-turn highlight used to depend on an `active` style key. The new model keeps semantic block style keys stable and records `selectedTurn` in metadata, with selection handled by `selectedPartId` instead of changing the part category.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review the fallback JSONL parser in `timeline-data.js`; it intentionally handles simple Pi-style rows and should not become a replacement for go-minitrace adapter work.
- Review operation inference for file read/write classification, especially command/tool names that imply writes without explicit file operation metadata.
- Review whether the app should persist raw uploads long-term or eventually store a smaller debug/fallback representation.

### What should be done in the future

- Add a richer fixture with explicit file write/patch operations so `file_write` is covered by smoke tests, not just by implementation logic.
- If go-minitrace adapters are expected to parse this sample fully, record a go-minitrace documentation/adapter follow-up.
- Consider a UI affordance for selected-turn metadata if reviewers want visible turn grouping beyond labels like `T1 read result`.

### Code review instructions

- Start in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/timeline-data.js` and review `fallbackRowsFromOriginalUpload()`.
- Then review `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-session-data.js`, especially `contextPartsForTurn()`, `contextFilePartsForTool()`, and `toolResultTokens()`.
- Check the legend entries in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-pages.js` match emitted style keys.
- Validate with:

```bash
cd /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz
pnpm --dir webapp typecheck
scripts/sync-widget-spa.sh
GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test
```

### Technical details

Manual API inspection command shape:

```bash
./dist/minitrace-viz serve site start --http-listen 127.0.0.1:18787
# POST test-fixtures/sample-pi-session.jsonl to /upload
# GET /api/timeline/:id, /api/sessions/:id/transcript-data, /api/sessions/:id/context-window-data
```

The successful sample emitted block IDs such as:

```text
turn-0-user user 30 T0 user
turn-1-assistant agent 11 T1 assistant
turn-1-thinking thinking 22 T1 thinking
turn-1-tool-call-tc-001 tool_call 20 T1 read call
turn-1-file-1-project-config-yaml file_read 21 T1 file read config.yaml
turn-1-tool-result-tc-001 tool_result 20 T1 read result
```

## Step 8: Close Phase 3 and Phase 4 as No-Change Upstream/DSL Decisions

This step reviewed whether the local Phase 2 implementation exposed any reusable design-system or Goja DSL gaps. It did not. The existing `ContextDiagramPanel`, context diagram molecules, `ContextStyleSet` contract, Widget IR props, and `context_window.dsl` helpers can already express the richer uploaded-session block snapshots.

I therefore treated Phase 3 and Phase 4 as validation-and-decision phases rather than implementation phases. This avoids adding upstream API surface just because the ticket listed possible future phases.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "continue to keep a frequent diary, and commit at appropriat eintervals."

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue the multi-phase implementation, keep diary entries at phase boundaries, and commit focused work instead of batching everything at the end.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants resumable, reviewable progress with clear commits and explicit reasoning for any no-op phases.

**Commit (code):** N/A — no upstream package or DSL code changes were required in this step.

### What I did

- Re-read `packages/rag-evaluation-site/GUIDELINES.md` before making any upstream design-system decision.
- Compared the Phase 2 local output against existing upstream contracts:
  - `ContextWindowPart.styleKey` supports caller-defined block categories.
  - `ContextStyleSet.legend` supports the new visible vocabulary.
  - `ContextDiagramPanel` already renders strip/stack/budget/treemap views from token-proportional parts.
  - `ContextDiagramPanel` detail view already shows note, preview, and metadata for file/tool blocks.
  - Widget IR already requires `snapshot` + `styleSet` for context diagram widgets.
  - `context_window.dsl.paletteStyleSet`, `contextPart`, `contextSnapshot`, and `contextDiagramPanel` already cover the emitted structures.
- Ran upstream package validation:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook
```

- Ran focused DSL/schema validation:

```bash
go test ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite ./pkg/widgetschema -count=1
```

### Why

- The project instruction was local-first: only change `rag-evaluation-site` or Goja DSL if the ClubMed implementation could not express the desired widgets locally.
- Adding a new reusable component or DSL helper without a real local constraint would violate the design-system guidelines and increase API surface unnecessarily.
- Existing Storybook coverage already demonstrates custom legends, transcript notes, and context diagram Widget IR rendering.

### What worked

- RAG package typecheck passed.
- Storybook build passed.
- Focused Go tests passed:

```text
ok  github.com/go-go-golems/rag-evaluation-system/pkg/widgetdsl
ok  github.com/go-go-golems/rag-evaluation-system/pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite
?   github.com/go-go-golems/rag-evaluation-system/pkg/widgetschema [no test files]
```

### What didn't work

- N/A. No upstream compile failures occurred, so the 200-second retry policy did not need to trigger.

### What I learned

- The hard `styleKey + ContextStyleSet` cutover paid off: minitrace-viz can define a domain-specific legend without changing package components.
- The remaining potential UX improvements, such as visible grouped turn separators, are enhancements rather than blockers for the requested Phase 2 behavior.
- DSL/schema helpers are already generic enough for this app-specific mapping; repeated minitrace mapping logic belongs in minitrace-viz, not in the generic DSL.

### What was tricky to build

- The tricky part was deciding not to build. The ticket listed Phase 3 and Phase 4 as possible implementation phases, but after Phase 2 there was no evidence-backed need for new upstream components or DSL helpers.
- I resolved that by validating the existing upstream package and DSL tests and recording the no-change decision in the diary rather than inventing unnecessary abstractions.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm that visible turn grouping inside diagrams is not required for the immediate handoff. Current labels and metadata identify turns, while the panel itself remains the standard `ContextDiagramPanel`.
- Confirm that app-local fallback parsing is acceptable until go-minitrace adapters fully normalize the lightweight sample fixture.

### What should be done in the future

- If users ask for grouped turn separators or a multi-snapshot pager inside the reusable design system, open a separate upstream package ticket with Storybook-first component work.
- If multiple apps need the same minitrace row-to-widget mapping, consider a shared helper package later; do not promote the current app-local fallback prematurely.

### Code review instructions

- There is no new upstream package or DSL code to review in this step.
- Review the validation outputs and the Phase 2 local implementation instead.
- Re-run validation with:

```bash
cd /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook
go test ./pkg/widgetdsl ./pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite ./pkg/widgetschema -count=1
```

### Technical details

Decision summary:

```text
Phase 3 upstream design-system changes: not required for current implementation.
Phase 4 Goja DSL/schema changes: not required for current implementation.
Reason: existing Widget IR + ContextStyleSet + context_window.dsl APIs express all Phase 2 output.
```

## Step 9: Run Final Validation and Close the Ticket Phases

This step completed Phase 5 validation and delivery documentation. It validated the local ClubMed implementation, upstream package/Storybook surfaces, Goja DSL/schema packages, live browser rendering, and css-visual-diff visual evidence.

The final validation included the uploaded sample session itself, not just static pages. The uploaded visualize page rendered `ContextDiagramPanel`, the uploaded transcript page rendered `TranscriptWorkspacePanel`, and API inspection confirmed the new block style keys are present.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 8)

**Assistant interpretation:** Keep recording progress and finish the remaining validation/delivery phase with committed documentation.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the work finished and reviewable when they return, with concrete validation evidence and no hidden uncommitted changes.

**Commit (code):** N/A — final validation/docs only in this step.

### What I did

- Started fresh local servers for final browser/visual validation:
  - ClubMed minitrace-viz on `127.0.0.1:18789`.
  - Static Storybook on `127.0.0.1:6009`.
- Uploaded `test-fixtures/sample-pi-session.jsonl` through the real `/upload` endpoint.
- Verified `/api/sessions/:id/context-window-data` includes required style keys:
  - `user`, `agent`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `file_read`.
- Ran Pi Playwright browser smoke across:
  - course landing,
  - upload page,
  - uploaded session visualize page,
  - uploaded session transcript page,
  - slides page,
  - handouts page,
  - context diagram Storybook story,
  - transcript/notes Storybook story,
  - course/handout Storybook story.
- Ran css-visual-diff final smoke capture:
  - `sources/visual-smoke/run-phase5-20260610-160514`.
- Updated the design guide with an implementation outcome section.
- Ran `docmgr doctor --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --stale-after 30`.

### Why

- Phase 5 requires final validation across changed areas and ticket documentation.
- The previous visual-smoke script covered course/upload/slides/handouts and Storybook; final Playwright also needed to cover the uploaded-session visualize/transcript routes created by Phase 2.
- Updating the design guide makes it clear which planned phases became code and which became explicit no-change decisions.

### What worked

- Fresh API inspection succeeded:

```text
uploaded session sess-mq8hylh0-pczjol
style keys ['agent', 'empty', 'file_read', 'system', 'thinking', 'tool_call', 'tool_result', 'user']
```

- Pi Playwright rendered all nine targets and wrote screenshots under:

```text
/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/.playwright-mcp/*-phase5-2026-06-10.png
```

- The only Playwright console error was Storybook `favicon.ico` returning 404, which is static-server noise and not a story/runtime failure.
- css-visual-diff succeeded and produced overlay/CSS evidence under:

```text
ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/sources/visual-smoke/run-phase5-20260610-160514
```

### What didn't work

- The first Phase 5 API inspection accidentally hit a stale server already bound to port `18788`. That stale server returned old `kind`-based parts, causing the style-key assertion to fail:

```text
style keys ['']
missing keys: {'file_read', 'user', 'agent', 'tool_result', 'tool_call'}
```

- The server log revealed the fresh process had failed to bind:

```text
listen on 127.0.0.1:18788: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:18788: bind: address already in use
```

- Fix: killed the stale listener and restarted validation on fresh ports `18789` and `6009`.
- An initial Playwright script attempted to use `require('fs')` inside the browser tool context and failed:

```text
ReferenceError: require is not defined
```

- Fix: read the session id separately and passed it as a string literal into the Playwright script.

### What I learned

- Fresh-port validation is safer than assuming a previous smoke server is gone.
- Final validation should include API data-shape checks as well as visual rendering checks, because a stale server can render a page but expose outdated `kind`-based data.
- Playwright browser-tool scripts run in a context where Node `require` is not available; pass fixture values explicitly.

### What was tricky to build

- The trickiest final-validation issue was stale server detection. The first server startup command did not fail the surrounding readiness check because an old process was already serving the health endpoint. I diagnosed this by inspecting the returned JSON and server log, then changed to fresh ports.
- The second tricky issue was distinguishing real browser console errors from static Storybook favicon noise. Inspecting `.playwright-mcp/console-2026-06-10T20-04-25-196Z.log` confirmed the only error was `/favicon.ico`.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review the final visual evidence screenshots and overlays for readability of small file/tool blocks.
- Review whether the `original-upload.txt` fallback should be documented as temporary until go-minitrace adapter coverage improves.
- Review whether untracked `ClubMedMeetup/ttmp/2026/06/10/MINIVIZ-010...` belongs to another active workstream; I intentionally did not stage or modify it.

### What should be done in the future

- Add a file-write fixture so `file_write` is smoke-tested directly.
- Add a dedicated visual-smoke target for uploaded visualize/transcript pages if repeated evidence captures should include dynamic uploaded sessions.
- Consider adding Makefile support for `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false` if generated xgoja local builds keep requiring it.

### Code review instructions

- Review commits in order:
  - ClubMed `58ee4d3` for local implementation.
  - RAG `b8f270a`, `32159d0`, and the final Phase 5 docs commit for ticket updates.
- Validate with the commands listed in the design guide's implementation outcome section.
- Inspect final css-visual-diff summary:
  - `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/sources/visual-smoke/run-phase5-20260610-160514/01-visual-smoke-summary.md`.

## Step 10: Remove Noisy Derived Annotations

This step followed up on review feedback that the auto-generated transcript/context annotations were noisy. The implementation now suppresses token-spike, cache-activity, failed-tool, large-output, and file-heavy derived annotations. Only model-change and explicit compaction/context-summary annotations remain.

The context diagram still keeps per-part `note` fields for selected-part details. What changed is the side annotation/note rails: they no longer get populated with a note for every block or every tool heuristic.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "remove the derived annotations, they're just noise, except model changes and compaction."

**Assistant interpretation:** Remove heuristic derived annotations from minitrace-viz transcript/context outputs, preserving only high-signal annotations for model switches and compaction events.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the transcript and context note rails to stop showing generic noise so reviewers focus on actual session content and exceptional events.

**Commit (code):** d38d877 — "Minitrace viz: reduce derived annotations"

### What I did

- Updated `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-session-data.js`.
- Removed tool-level derived annotation generation entirely.
- Changed turn-level annotation generation to emit only:
  - model-change annotations when a non-empty model changes from the previous non-empty model,
  - compaction annotations when a turn explicitly looks like a compaction/context-summary event.
- Changed context side notes to include only model-change or compaction parts.
- Kept part-level `note` text intact for selected context-block details.

### Why

- The prior derived annotations were heuristic and mostly restated data already visible in the transcript or context blocks.
- Model changes and compaction are exceptional session events that are worth keeping in review rails.

### What worked

- Syntax check passed:

```bash
node --check lib/course-session-data.js
```

- Local smoke passed:

```text
=== Results: 7 passed, 0 failed ===
```

- API check on the sample upload now reports no noisy derived annotations:

```text
transcript annotations 0 []
context notes 0 []
```

### What didn't work

- `make test` regenerated unrelated xgoja/embed artifacts and changed `minitrace-viz/Makefile` in the working tree. I inspected the diff, confirmed it was not part of the annotation cleanup, restored those files, and removed newly generated untracked asset files.

### What I learned

- The context selected-part details and annotation rails serve different purposes. Keeping `part.note` is useful; auto-populating side rails from every part is noisy.
- Model-change detection needs previous non-empty model state; annotating every model-bearing turn is not helpful.

### What was tricky to build

- The tricky part was preserving useful selected-part details while removing noisy side-rail annotations. I changed `contextNotes()` rather than deleting block notes from the model.
- Another subtlety was build-tool noise: validation touched generated files that were not related to the requested change, so I restored them before committing.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm the compaction detector's string matching is conservative enough. It only looks for explicit compaction/context-summary terms.
- Confirm whether cache creation/read tokens should ever be considered compaction in this UI; they are currently not annotated.

### What should be done in the future

- Add a fixture with explicit model changes and compaction events to cover the two remaining allowed annotation types.

### Code review instructions

- Review `deriveTurnAnnotations()`, `isCompactionTurn()`, and `contextNotes()` in `ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-session-data.js`.
- Validate with:

```bash
cd /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz
GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test
```

### Technical details

Removed annotation categories:

```text
token spike
cache activity
failed tool
tool failure
large tool output
file-heavy tool
per-block context notes
```

Kept annotation categories:

```text
model change
explicit compaction/context summary
```
