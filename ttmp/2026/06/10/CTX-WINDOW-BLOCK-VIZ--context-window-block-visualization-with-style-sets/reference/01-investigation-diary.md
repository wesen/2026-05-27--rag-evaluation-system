# Diary

## Goal

This diary records the planning-only work for CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ: creating the docmgr ticket, inspecting the existing style-set/context-window Widget IR architecture, writing an intern-facing implementation guide, and publishing the design bundle to reMarkable. No application code was changed in this step.

## Step 1: Create the ticket and write the implementation guide

This step established a dedicated ticket workspace and captured the architecture/design guide before implementation begins. The main output is a detailed guide that explains the existing `styleKey + ContextStyleSet` system, the current context diagram components, the Widget IR/Goja DSL entrypoints, and a phased plan for turning uploaded sessions into colored token-proportional context-window blocks.

The work intentionally stopped at documentation. The requested feature needs a schema decision for uploaded sessions before implementation, especially for turn boundaries, exact token counts, and whether per-turn context-window snapshots are available.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Create a new docmgr ticket (with default root) in order to use the new color style + legend functionality for context window widgets, and update the visualization of the uploaded session to show the content of the context window as colored blocks for the different types of blocks:

system / user / agent / tool call / tool result / file read/write / thinking ... The size of the blocks should be proportional to their token size (up to readability limits). if possible, point out the individual turns (it might not be possible, in which case the design system will need to be updated, point those out). Or maybe make a version where one can page through the individual turns.

Before starting: 

Create  a detailed analysis / design / implementation guide that is for a new intern, explaining all the parts of the system needed to understand what it is, with prose paragraphs and bullet point sand pseudocode and diagrams and api references and file references. It should be very clear and technical. Store in the ticket and the nupload to remarkable.

Add ASCII screenshots / renderings of what the widgets would look like.

Keep a diary as you work.

Don't start the actual work."

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a new docmgr ticket under the repository default `ttmp` root, investigate the existing context-window style-set and Widget IR architecture, write a detailed implementation guide with ASCII renderings and file references, keep a diary, and upload the resulting documentation bundle to reMarkable without touching production feature code.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants a high-quality design handoff for a future implementer/intern before coding begins, with enough source-backed context to avoid breaking the recently added palette/legend architecture.

**Commit (code):** N/A — no code changes were made.

### What I did

- Ran `docmgr status --summary-only` to confirm the default docs root.
- Created ticket `CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ` with title `Context Window Block Visualization With Style Sets`.
- Added a design doc: `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/design-doc/01-design-and-implementation-guide.md`.
- Added this diary: `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/reference/01-investigation-diary.md`.
- Added ticket tasks for guide writing, source-file relations, validation, and reMarkable upload.
- Inspected the existing architecture with repository searches and line-numbered source reads:
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/types.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context/styles.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/ContextStripDiagram/ContextStripDiagram.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/ContextStackDiagram/ContextStackDiagram.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/molecules/ContextTreemap/ContextTreemap.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/ContextDiagramPanel/ContextDiagramPanel.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/ir.ts`
  - `pkg/widgetdsl/module.go`
  - `pkg/xgoja/providers/widgetsite/provider.go`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.context-diagrams.stories.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/ContextUploadDropArea/ContextUploadDropArea.tsx`
- Wrote the design guide with:
  - executive summary,
  - problem statement and scope,
  - architecture overview,
  - source-backed file references,
  - proposed uploaded-session normalization model,
  - style-set vocabulary,
  - Widget IR/Goja DSL pseudocode,
  - ASCII renderings,
  - phased implementation plan,
  - design-system gaps,
  - decision records,
  - testing strategy and handoff checklist.

### Why

- The user explicitly asked for design and analysis before starting implementation.
- The feature depends on uploaded-session schema details that are not yet documented, so a safe plan needs to separate existing UI capabilities from missing runtime data.
- The style-set system is intentionally generic; future code should preserve `styleKey + ContextStyleSet` rather than creating another hardcoded enum.

### What worked

- `docmgr ticket create-ticket` created the workspace under the repository default root.
- The existing source architecture already supports most of the desired rendering through `ContextWindowPart`, `ContextStyleSet`, `ContextDiagramPanel`, Widget IR props, and Goja DSL helpers.
- Existing Storybook examples already include a content-block-style snapshot with system/user/tool/result/answer blocks, which made the proposed implementation path concrete.
- The design guide could point to exact code locations for proportional sizing and readability floors.

### What didn't work

- One broad search command exited with code 2 because it included a path that was not available from the current repository root:

```bash
rg -n "Context(Window|Budget|Strip|Stack|Treemap|Diagram)|styleSet|styleKey|ContextStyle|transcript|turn|tool|file|thinking|message|trace|session|upload|tokens" packages/rag-evaluation-site/src pkg internal ClubMedMeetup -S
```

- The output still yielded useful results for existing paths, but the command return code indicated a search-path issue.
- I did not find an implementation-level uploaded-session parser during this planning pass. The visible upload component is presentational (`ContextUploadDropArea`) and the exact uploaded session schema remains an open question.

### What I learned

- The new style-set system is already the right abstraction for uploaded-session block categories; the gap is session normalization, not palette rendering.
- `ContextStripDiagram`, `ContextStackDiagram`, and `ContextTreemap` already implement token-proportional rendering with readability floors.
- Turn-level visualization is data-dependent. If the uploaded session does not record reliable turn boundaries or per-turn context-window membership, the design system can only approximate turn labels or needs runtime/schema support.
- `ContextDiagramPanel` already has selected-part detail rendering that can show content previews and metadata, which is useful for file read/write and tool result inspection.

### What was tricky to build

- The user asked for a future visualization of an "uploaded session", but the source schema for that session is not yet identified in the visible code. The guide had to avoid pretending that turn paging or exact token accounting is guaranteed.
- There are two overlapping but distinct concepts: a transcript and the actual model context window. A transcript can be transformed into approximate blocks, but exact context-window membership requires runtime data about compaction, evictions, summaries, and injected system/tool state.
- The category "thinking" needs careful wording. The design guide treats it as explicit scratchpad/generated notes only, not hidden chain-of-thought inference.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm the real uploaded session schema before implementation.
- Confirm whether token counts are present, estimated, or should be computed with a tokenizer.
- Confirm whether turn paging should show cumulative approximate snapshots or only exact runtime-provided snapshots.
- Review the proposed block vocabulary (`system`, `user`, `agent`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `file_read`, `file_write`, `thinking`, etc.) against real uploaded data.

### What should be done in the future

- Add representative uploaded session JSON samples to the ticket `sources/` directory if they are safe to store.
- Decide whether the normalizer should live in the frontend package, backend host app, or a shared package.
- Implement only after the design guide has been reviewed.
- If turn boundaries are required visually, prototype either `ContextTurnPagerPanel` or `ContextGroupedStripDiagram` in Storybook before integrating runtime uploads.

### Code review instructions

- There is no production code to review in this step.
- Review the design guide first:
  - `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/design-doc/01-design-and-implementation-guide.md`
- Validate that file references match the current architecture and that the proposed phased plan does not introduce implementation before schema confirmation.
- After reMarkable upload, verify that the uploaded PDF includes the design guide and diary.

### Technical details

Commands run:

```bash
docmgr status --summary-only
docmgr ticket create-ticket --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --title "Context Window Block Visualization With Style Sets" --topics frontend,visualization,context-window,storybook,widget-ir
docmgr doc add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --doc-type design-doc --title "Design and Implementation Guide"
docmgr doc add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --doc-type reference --title "Investigation Diary"
docmgr task add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --text "Write intern-facing architecture and implementation guide before code changes"
docmgr task add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --text "Relate source files that define style sets, context snapshots, Widget IR, and DSL entrypoints"
docmgr task add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --text "Validate ticket hygiene with docmgr doctor"
docmgr task add --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --text "Upload design bundle to reMarkable"
```

Key source facts captured in the design guide:

- `ContextWindowPart` carries `styleKey`, `tokens`, content preview/content, token offsets, and metadata.
- `ContextStyleSet` carries caller-defined styles and legend items.
- `ContextDiagramPanel` can switch between strip, stack, budget, and treemap views.
- Goja DSL helpers can emit visual styles, legend items, style sets, context parts, context snapshots, and context diagram recipe nodes.

## Step 2: Validate and upload the design bundle

This step completed the documentation delivery loop. After the guide and diary were written, I related the source files that shaped the design, ran `docmgr doctor`, and uploaded a bundled PDF to reMarkable after a dry run.

The upload makes the planning package reviewable away from the terminal. It includes the ticket index, the design guide, the diary, tasks, and changelog.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 1)

**Assistant interpretation:** Complete docmgr bookkeeping, validate the ticket, and upload the resulting design bundle to reMarkable while still avoiding feature implementation.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the intern-facing design package available in both the repository ticket and on reMarkable for reading/review.

**Commit (code):** N/A — no code changes were made.

### What I did

- Related the design doc to the key source files inspected during analysis.
- Related the diary to the design doc and the most important source files.
- Checked completed tasks for guide writing, file relations, and validation.
- Ran `docmgr doctor --ticket CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ --stale-after 30`.
- Verified `remarquee status` and `remarquee cloud account --non-interactive`.
- Ran a dry-run bundle upload to `/ai/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ`.
- Uploaded the real PDF bundle to `/ai/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ`.
- Verified the remote listing contains `CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ Design Guide`.

### Why

- The ticket-research workflow requires source-file relations, validation, and dry-run-before-real-upload delivery.
- The reMarkable upload should include enough context for offline review, not just the design doc alone.

### What worked

- `docmgr doctor` reported all checks passed.
- `remarquee status` returned `remarquee: ok`.
- The reMarkable account check returned `user=wesen@ruinwesen.com sync_version=1.5`.
- Dry-run upload showed the expected bundle contents.
- Real upload succeeded and `remarquee cloud ls` showed the uploaded bundle.

### What didn't work

- N/A.

### What I learned

- The generated bundle flow is suitable for design packages because it can combine index, guide, diary, tasks, and changelog into one PDF with a table of contents.

### What was tricky to build

- The main sequencing constraint was to validate and dry-run before real upload. This avoids sending malformed or incomplete PDFs to the reMarkable destination.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm that the uploaded PDF renders the large ASCII diagrams and pseudocode blocks clearly on the reMarkable screen.
- Confirm that the bundle contents are the desired scope; a later upload could include source snippets if needed.

### What should be done in the future

- If the design changes after schema review, upload a revised bundle rather than editing the already-uploaded PDF in place.

### Code review instructions

- Review the final docmgr artifacts in the ticket workspace.
- Verify reMarkable path `/ai/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ` contains `CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ Design Guide`.

## Step 3: Remove live/course session shell from the active workspace surface

This step changed the active session workspace surface so it no longer presents the live/course-style navigation model. The visible shell now stays focused on the requested flow: upload a session, visualize its context/window blocks, and inspect the transcript.

I committed the cleanup in two small intervals: first limiting the default shell navigation, then replacing the Storybook course/handout surface with Upload / Visualize / Transcript examples. This keeps the reusable lower-level course widgets in the library for now, but removes them from the session workspace presentation path.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "remove the new live session view part of the code, and keep it at upload + visualize/transcript.

commit at appropriate intervals, and keep a frequent diary."

**Assistant interpretation:** Remove the newly exposed live/course-style session view from the user-facing workspace surface, preserve only Upload, Visualize, and Transcript as the intended workflow, commit focused changes as they complete, and update the diary frequently.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the scope tightened before further implementation so the UI does not imply a live-session/course presentation mode; the product should remain an uploaded-session analysis workflow.

**Commit (code):** 560864d — "Frontend: limit session shell nav"

**Commit (code):** 2edac8e — "Storybook: focus session workspace stories"

### What I did

- Updated `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/courseStudioNav.ts` so the exported default sections contain only:
  - Upload
  - Visualize
  - Transcript
- Updated `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/CourseStudioShell.stories.tsx` so examples default to `visualize` instead of `slides` and use session-workspace footer text.
- Rewrote `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.course-handout.stories.tsx` into a session workspace story module:
  - renamed the Storybook title from `Widget IR/Renderer/Course Studio` to `Widget IR/Renderer/Session Workspace`,
  - removed course landing, slide composition, handout, and course+handout split-view story exports,
  - added `UploadWorkspace`, `VisualizeWorkspace`, and `TranscriptWorkspace`,
  - kept palette controls on the visualize/transcript examples.
- Ran `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck` after each code interval.

### Why

- The live/course shell and course/handout stories made the workspace look like a live workshop/session product instead of an uploaded-session analysis tool.
- The requested product scope is upload plus visualization/transcript inspection.
- Keeping the reusable widgets but removing them from the workspace surface is a smaller, safer cut than deleting library components and DSL exports that may still be useful elsewhere.

### What worked

- TypeScript passed after limiting the navigation.
- TypeScript passed after replacing the Storybook surface.
- The commits stayed focused:
  - one for the default shell nav,
  - one for Storybook/session workspace scope.

### What didn't work

- Searching for a literal `LiveSession`, `live-session`, or `Live Session` symbol did not find a matching code symbol in `packages/rag-evaluation-site`. The live-session concept was represented indirectly by course/slides/handout navigation and stories rather than a literal component name.
- A broad workspace search also surfaced a sibling `go-minitrace` app, which has session/transcript screens, but the active repository work stayed in `2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system` because the current task and ticket are in this package.

### What I learned

- The scope boundary is mostly presentation-level right now. The library still includes course/slide/handout widgets, but the session workspace no longer advertises those as the active flow.
- Storybook names and story exports matter because they are effectively product surfaces for reviewers.

### What was tricky to build

- The phrase "live session view" did not map to an exact symbol. I resolved this by removing the course/slides/handout presentation surfaces while preserving upload, visualize, and transcript paths.
- The package has reusable course widgets and a course DSL. Deleting those immediately would be a broader API-breaking change than the prompt required, so I limited this step to the workspace navigation and Storybook surface.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm whether the reusable `CourseLessonPanel`, `CourseSlidePanel`, `HandoutDocumentShell`, and `course.dsl` exports should remain available as package/library examples, or whether the user wants those deleted in a later hard-removal pass.
- Confirm whether package docs should also be renamed away from "Course Studio" now that the active workspace surface is upload/visualize/transcript.

### What should be done in the future

- If the product should remove the course/handout API entirely, do that as a separate explicit breaking-change step with schema/DSL/docs/test updates.
- Consider renaming `CourseStudioShell` if the component is now intended to be a generic session workspace shell rather than a course shell.

### Code review instructions

- Start with `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/courseStudioNav.ts` to verify the default navigation has only Upload, Visualize, and Transcript.
- Then review `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.course-handout.stories.tsx` to verify the Storybook surface no longer exposes course landing/slides/handouts.
- Validate with:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
```

### Technical details

Validation commands:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
```

Search commands used during orientation:

```bash
rg -n "LiveSession|live session|live-session|Live Session|session view|SessionView|active session|realtime|real-time" packages/rag-evaluation-site/src pkg internal cmd .github --glob '!node_modules/**' --glob '!dist/**' --glob '!storybook-static/**' -S
rg -n "CourseLessonLanding|CourseSlide|TeachingSlide|Handout|CoursePlusHandout|course|slides|comments|handout|Present|Take-home|Workshop|Course Studio|live session|Live on a real session" packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/context packages/rag-evaluation-site/README.md packages/rag-evaluation-site/GUIDELINES.md -S
```

## Step 4: Ground the design in go-minitrace schema and DSL outputs

This step corrected the design assumptions before further cleanup. The earlier guide treated uploaded JSON as a mostly arbitrary source format. The actual integration uses go-minitrace and minitracejs, so the right input to the widgets is the normalized minitrace session schema and DSL query/view rows.

The guide now explains session metadata, ordered turns, tool calls, per-turn token usage, transcript rows, timeline rows, token usage rows, and turn frames. It also adds precise mappings from minitrace rows to transcript messages and context-window parts, including file read/write detection from normalized tool `operation_type` values.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "it could be that the docs are not precise enough and need to be expanded, in cas eyou find things that are unclear. 

But yes, first update the design documentation with th eminitrace schema and mapping updates, then restore the stuff you removed, then remove only the litellm-live-service.js.

Before you start working on that, add phases + for each phase, a detailed list oif tasks to the ticket. then implement them in sequence, committing at appropriate intervals, keeping a freqeunt diary.

Once you are done with all the cleanup, add phases and tasks for the widget improvements, then implement them, making sure to adhere to the proper guidelines. Start with what can be done entirely on the clubmeetup/minitrace-viz side, then to the changes that rqeuire upstream schanges in 2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/ and the goja DSL. Make sure to adhere to the @2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/GUIDELINES.md  and the style of the react design system, the structure of it is really at the heart of the whole system."

**Assistant interpretation:** Add phased ticket tasks first, then update the design guide with concrete minitrace schema/DSL mappings before touching code. After that, restore my over-broad removals and remove only the LiteLLM live service.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants the work sequenced carefully, with the design grounded in actual go-minitrace data contracts and with any unclear documentation gaps surfaced instead of guessed around.

**Commit (code):** N/A — documentation interval before code cleanup.

### What I did

- Replaced `tasks.md` with phased task groups covering recovery, minitrace mapping design, ClubMeetup/minitrace-viz local improvements, upstream widget package changes, DSL/schema support, and final validation.
- Read go-minitrace schema and DSL references:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/doc/minitrace-schema.md`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/doc/js-api-reference.md`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/minitracejs/query_view_session.go`
- Added a new `go-minitrace Data Contract for Uploaded Sessions` section to the design guide.
- Documented concrete output fields for `TranscriptRows`, `TurnRows`, `ToolRows`, `TimelineRows`, `TokenUsageRows`, and `TurnFrames`.
- Added mapping sketches for `TranscriptRow -> TranscriptMessage` and `TranscriptRow + ToolRow -> ContextWindowPart`.
- Added a documentation-gap list for unclear go-minitrace behavior, such as exact context-window membership and tool-call request row availability.

### Why

- The widgets should consume normalized minitrace rows, not re-parse raw uploaded JSON.
- The presence of `operation_type` and per-turn usage data changes the implementation strategy: file read/write and token sizes can be more precise than originally documented.
- The design doc needs to be accurate before cleanup and implementation continue.

### What worked

- The minitrace schema gives enough structure for transcript widgets and context block diagrams.
- `TranscriptRows` already flatten messages, thinking, and optional tool rows into a widget-friendly order.
- `ToolRows` provides normalized operation metadata that can drive `file_read`, `file_write`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, and `tool_error` styles.

### What didn't work

- The docs do not yet appear to answer whether exact model context-window membership is available for every adapter. That remains a documented gap.
- It is also unclear whether `TranscriptRows` should include explicit tool-call request rows, or only result/error rows with command/file fallback text.

### What I learned

- go-minitrace is the correct normalization boundary for uploaded session data.
- Context block conversion should be based on minitrace DSL rows and tool operation types.
- The design-system work can likely start locally in ClubMeetup/minitrace-viz before requiring upstream package or Goja DSL changes.

### What was tricky to build

- The original design had a generic normalizer section. I kept a normalized app-side representation, but reframed it as derived from minitrace rows so the guide remains useful without fighting the existing architecture.
- The word "thinking" needs explicit caveats: minitrace can expose `turns[].thinking` when captured, but the UI must not imply hidden reasoning reconstruction.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm whether the minitrace DSL should add a first-class view that already emits `ContextWindowPart`-ready rows.
- Confirm how LiteLLM live service removal affects the upload/import path, if at all.
- Confirm whether go-minitrace docs should expand `TranscriptRows` field definitions and exact row-kind semantics.

### What should be done in the future

- Expand go-minitrace docs if implementation discovers undocumented row shapes or adapter-specific behavior.
- Consider adding a reusable minitrace-to-widget mapping helper after the local ClubMeetup/minitrace-viz implementation proves stable.

### Code review instructions

- Review the new `go-minitrace Data Contract for Uploaded Sessions` section in the design guide.
- Check that it references minitrace schema/DSL source files and does not invent raw-upload behavior.

### Technical details

Relevant source files:

- `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/doc/minitrace-schema.md`
- `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/doc/js-api-reference.md`
- `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/go-minitrace/pkg/minitracejs/query_view_session.go`

## Step 5: Restore the over-removed course, slide, and handout surfaces

This step recovered from the earlier misunderstanding. The user clarified that slides and handouts should stay; only the recently added LiteLLM live service should be removed. I restored the course workspace navigation and Storybook course/handout examples from the merge baseline while keeping the new minitrace design documentation.

The recovery was done as a focused commit after a frontend typecheck. This puts the React package back into the expected state before removing the actual live-service code.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (same as Step 4)

**Assistant interpretation:** Restore the course/slides/handouts work I removed by mistake, then proceed to the narrow LiteLLM live-service cleanup.

**Inferred user intent:** Preserve the workshop/course material and handout surfaces; remove only the real-time LiteLLM service addition.

**Commit (code):** 5cd3fb1 — "Frontend: restore course workspace surfaces"

### What I did

- Restored these files from commit `3a4cc1f`:
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.domain-registry.stories.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/courseStudioNav.ts`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/components/organisms/CourseStudioShell/CourseStudioShell.stories.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.course-handout.stories.tsx`
  - `packages/rag-evaluation-site/README.md`
- Ran `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`.
- Committed the restoration as `5cd3fb1`.

### Why

- The previous removal was too broad and conflicted with the clarified product intent.
- Restoring from the merge baseline avoids manually reconstructing course/handout examples and reduces risk.

### What worked

- TypeScript passed after restoring the files.
- The recovery commit was focused and did not undo the new minitrace design documentation.

### What didn't work

- N/A for the recovery itself. The earlier mistake is documented in Step 3.

### What I learned

- The phrase "live session view" referred specifically to `litellm-live-service.js`, not the course/session workspace shell.
- When a requested deletion is ambiguous, locate the exact file/symbol before removing UI surfaces.

### What was tricky to build

- The docs commit that introduced the ticket also included an over-narrow package README change. Restoring specific files from `3a4cc1f` was safer than reverting entire commits because the ticket docs and minitrace mapping updates should remain.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Confirm no course/handout story or nav surface remains unintentionally changed after the restore.

### What should be done in the future

- Continue with the narrow `litellm-live-service.js` removal only.

### Code review instructions

- Review commit `5cd3fb1` to verify it restores course/slides/handouts and does not introduce new behavior.
- Validate with:

```bash
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
```

## Step 6: Remove LiteLLM live integration and run visual smoke tests

This step completed the Phase 0 cleanup that had been blocked on scope precision: remove the local JavaScript LiteLLM live/realtime service, but keep the course, slides, handouts, upload, transcript, and context-window surfaces. After the cleanup, I treated validation as a visual workflow, not just a typecheck: server smoke, Storybook build, Pi Playwright browser smoke, and css-visual-diff overlay/CSS capture all ran against the restored pages.

The smoke work also found a real upstream React warning in Storybook. `WidgetRenderer` was returning arrays of unkeyed rendered children, which surfaced when the course/handout registry story rendered `CourseStudioShell`; I fixed that by wrapping rendered children in keyed fragments.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "continue and do proper storybook / playwright / css-visual-diff smoke tests, using past tickets or docs for the expected procedure."

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue the cleanup, use the prior visual-quality ticket as the test procedure model, validate both the ClubMed minitrace-viz app and Storybook surfaces in a real browser, and record/fix issues found during smoke testing.

**Inferred user intent:** The user wants confidence that the narrow LiteLLM live-service removal did not regress restored course/slides/handouts or the context/transcript visual surfaces.

**Commit (code):** ace0505 — "Tests: add ClubMed visual smoke coverage"; 49fd9fa — "Frontend: remove LiteLLM live service"

### What I did

- Removed the JavaScript live service file:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/litellm-live-service.js`
- Removed direct live-service integration points from:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/server.js`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-pages.js`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/webapp/src/main.tsx`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/test-fixtures/smoke-test.sh`
- Preserved the restored course/slides/handouts pages and their Storybook surfaces.
- Added a ticket-local css-visual-diff script:
  - `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/scripts/01-capture-clubmed-visual-smoke.js`
- Ran package and app validation:
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build`
  - `pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook`
  - `pnpm --dir webapp typecheck`
  - `scripts/sync-widget-spa.sh`
  - `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make build`
  - `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test`
- Ran Pi Playwright smoke against:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:18787/pages/course`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:18787/pages/upload`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:18787/pages/slides`
  - `http://127.0.0.1:18787/pages/handouts`
  - Storybook `widget-ir-renderer-context-diagrams--custom-three-label-widget-ir`
  - Storybook `widget-ir-renderer-transcript-and-notes--annotated-transcript-with-notes-rail`
  - Storybook `widget-ir-renderer-domain-registry-coverage--course-handout-registry-surface`
- Ran css-visual-diff capture successfully into:
  - `ttmp/2026/06/10/CTX-WINDOW-BLOCK-VIZ--context-window-block-visualization-with-style-sets/sources/visual-smoke/run-20260610-154533`
- Fixed a React key warning surfaced by Playwright in:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.tsx`

### Why

- The user explicitly narrowed cleanup to `litellm-live-service.js` and direct live/realtime integration references.
- Server smoke verifies the uploaded-session APIs still work after removing the old live endpoints.
- Storybook and browser smoke verify that restored course/slides/handouts remain visually reachable and that the context/transcript Storybook surfaces still render.
- css-visual-diff gives durable visual evidence: overlay screenshots, preflight JSON, and computed CSS JSON for each page/story.

### What worked

- Source grep after cleanup found no remaining direct source references to:
  - `litellm-live-service`
  - `live-litellm`
  - `/api/live/litellm`
  - `clear-litellm-live`
  - `refresh-litellm-live`
- Clean server smoke passed after stopping the stale test server:

```text
=== Results: 6 passed, 0 failed ===
```

- RAG package validation passed:

```text
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site build-storybook
```

- ClubMed webapp/app validation passed:

```text
pnpm --dir webapp typecheck
scripts/sync-widget-spa.sh
GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make build
GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test
```

- Pi Playwright rerun passed with no non-favicon console errors for all seven checked pages/stories.
- css-visual-diff succeeded after script fixes and produced overlays for all seven targets.

### What didn't work

- Initial `make build` failed from Go VCS stamping in the generated temporary xgoja module:

```text
Error: go build -o /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/dist/minitrace-viz . failed: exit status 1
error obtaining VCS status: exit status 128
	Use -buildvcs=false to disable VCS stamping.
```

- Fix: reran xgoja build/test with `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false`.
- My first helper script used an over-broad `pkill -f` pattern and interrupted itself before starting the smoke servers. I restarted without pre-killing by broad pattern.
- The first Playwright smoke found a real React console error:

```text
Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
Check the render method of `CourseStudioShell`.  It was passed a child from WidgetRenderer.
```

- Fix: changed `WidgetRenderer.renderChildren()` to return keyed fragments based on component `key`, `id`, type/tag, and index.
- The first css-visual-diff run failed during summary writing because I used a non-existent `cvd.read.json` helper:

```text
Error: promise rejected: TypeError: Cannot read property 'json' of undefined or null
```

- Fix: tracked missing preflight probes in memory while writing each preflight file.
- The second css-visual-diff run failed because I required a `ContextDiagramPanel` probe on the slides page, but the slide surface renders direct diagram content instead:

```text
Error: promise rejected: Error: Missing required visual probes: clubmed-slides:context-panel
```

- Fix: relaxed the slides probe to require `CourseSlidePanel` only.

### What I learned

- The ClubMed app's normal validation path is `make build`/`make test`, but on this machine xgoja's generated temp module needs `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false` for reliable local builds.
- The prior WIDGETDSL visual-quality ticket provides a good pattern: serve the app and static Storybook, capture overlays and computed CSS JSON with css-visual-diff, and store the script/artifacts under the ticket.
- Browser smoke is useful even when TypeScript/builds pass; it caught the unkeyed children warning in a restored Storybook surface.
- The slides page should be probed by its course-level organism (`CourseSlidePanel`) rather than assuming it wraps content in `ContextDiagramPanel`.

### What was tricky to build

- The tricky scope issue was separating direct LiteLLM live-service references from unrelated course/slides/handout surfaces. I removed the JS service, HTTP routes, page/nav entry, refresh bridge, and smoke checks while preserving the upload/session workflow and course materials.
- The tricky validation issue was stale server state. A first `make test` appeared to pass after a bind error because an old server was still listening on the same port; I stopped the stale smoke server and reran `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false make test` cleanly.
- The css-visual-diff script needed selectors that match actual rendered surfaces. Over-specific component assumptions created false failures, so I adjusted the script to require semantic page-level organisms and keep overlay targets focused.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review whether the Python `minitrace_viz_litellm/` callback helper and `test-fixtures/litellm-chat-completion.json` should remain as historical/reference material or be removed in a later, explicitly scoped cleanup. I did not remove them in this step because the user asked for the JS live service and direct references only.
- Review the `WidgetRenderer` keyed-fragment fix because it changes the generic Widget IR rendering path, even though it is intended to be a React correctness fix.
- Review generated SPA asset diffs to confirm they only reflect the removed refresh bridge and the rebuilt package dependency.

### What should be done in the future

- Add a small committed wrapper script for starting/stopping the visual smoke servers if this becomes a repeated workflow.
- Decide whether `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false` belongs in the minitrace-viz Makefile or xgoja build command for local generated-module builds.
- If visual smoke artifacts become too large for normal commits, keep only the script and summary, or move screenshots to ignored evidence storage.

### Code review instructions

- Start with the narrow cleanup files:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/server.js`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/lib/course-pages.js`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/webapp/src/main.tsx`
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/ClubMedMeetup/minitrace-viz/test-fixtures/smoke-test.sh`
- Then review the React correctness fix:
  - `/home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system/packages/rag-evaluation-site/src/widgets/WidgetRenderer.tsx`
- Validate with:

```bash
cd /home/manuel/workspaces/2026-06-07/club-meetup-site/2026-05-27--rag-evaluation-system
pnpm --dir packages/rag-evaluation-site typecheck
