# Diary

## Goal

This diary records the planning work for the base retrieval foundation needed before benchmark design: BM25 search, query-vector search, hybrid retrieval, and smoke-query validation.

## Step 1: Create Retrieval Foundation Ticket and Design Guide

I created a new docmgr ticket for the next phase of the RAG Evaluation System: proving that real queries can retrieve plausible chunks from the corpus before designing benchmarks. The guide focuses on base functionality rather than the Corpus Explorer UI.

The main design decision is to implement retrieval in layers. BM25 lexical search comes first because it is cheap, deterministic, and explainable. Query-vector search comes next because embeddings already exist, but the system still needs user-query-to-chunk retrieval. Hybrid search and smoke-query checks should come only after the individual retrievers work on their own.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Create a new ticket and Create  a detailed analysis / design / implementation guide that is for a new intern, explaining all the parts of the system needed to understand what it is, with prose paragraphs and bullet point sand pseudocode and diagrams and api references and file references. It should be very clear and technical. Store in the ticket and the nupload to remarkable."

**Assistant interpretation:** Create a new docmgr ticket for implementing end-to-end retrieval functionality, write a clear intern-ready technical guide, store it in the ticket, and upload it to reMarkable.

**Inferred user intent:** Move from corpus/chunk inspection into base retrieval validation so the project can run real corpus queries before investing in benchmark design.

### What I did

- Created ticket `RAGEVAL-004` titled `End-to-End Search Retrieval Foundation`.
- Added tasks for:
  - BM25 lexical search design;
  - query-vector search design;
  - hybrid retrieval and smoke testing;
  - reMarkable upload.
- Wrote `design-doc/01-end-to-end-search-retrieval-implementation-guide.md`.
- The guide covers:
  - current system state;
  - retrieval architecture;
  - BM25 service design;
  - vector query search design;
  - hybrid/RRF design;
  - CLI command plan;
  - HTTP API plan;
  - DB query additions;
  - smoke query file design;
  - validation sequence;
  - implementation phases.

### Why

The system has chunks and partial embeddings, but it cannot yet answer real questions by returning ranked evidence chunks. Benchmark design would be premature until BM25, vector search, and hybrid search can each be validated independently.

### What worked

- Existing project structure gives clear extension points:
  - `internal/services/search/` for retrieval logic;
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/` for CLI commands;
  - `internal/api/handlers.go` for HTTP endpoints;
  - `internal/db/queries.go` or `internal/db/search_queries.go` for chunk/document/index metadata queries.
- Existing tables already include `search_indexes`, which can track disposable BM25 indexes rebuilt from canonical SQLite chunks.
- Existing embedding code provides vector encoding/decoding and cosine similarity helpers that query-vector search can reuse.

### What didn't work

- No code implementation was done in this step. This ticket creates the design package for the next implementation pass.
- The current system does not yet have a search service or search CLI commands.

### What I learned

- The next milestone should be retrieval observability, not evaluation metrics.
- BM25 should be implemented first because it reveals ingestion/chunking/text problems without provider costs.
- Query-vector search should scan stored embeddings with explicit candidate limits before introducing native vector indexes.
- Product queries may fail because product metadata is not yet fully composed into `documents.content_text`; that should be treated as a corpus text issue before tuning retrievers.

### What was tricky to build

The main design challenge was keeping the scope focused. It is tempting to jump directly to benchmarks, hybrid ranking, or LLM evaluation. The guide instead stages the work so each layer has a standalone validation path: BM25 first, then vector query search, then hybrid, then smoke query sets, and only then formal benchmarks.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review the recommendation to use Bleve for BM25 instead of SQLite FTS5.
- Review the proposed `/api/v1/search/*` route shapes.
- Review whether vector search should initially scan SQLite embeddings or introduce a vector index earlier.
- Review the smoke query schema before implementation so it stays lightweight and does not become a premature benchmark framework.

### What should be done in the future

- Implement Phase 1 BM25 service and CLI.
- Run manual TTC queries against guides/articles.
- Add vector query search using existing Geppetto/Pinocchio provider resolution.
- Add hybrid search only after BM25 and vector results are independently plausible.
- Create `eval/ttc-smoke.yaml` after retrieval works.

### Code review instructions

- Start with:
  - `ttmp/2026/05/28/RAGEVAL-004--end-to-end-search-retrieval-foundation/design-doc/01-end-to-end-search-retrieval-implementation-guide.md`
- Then inspect implementation extension points:
  - `internal/db/db.go`
  - `internal/db/queries.go`
  - `internal/services/embedding/service.go`
  - `internal/services/embedding/similarity.go`
  - `internal/services/embedding/vector.go`
  - `internal/services/corpus/service.go`
  - `internal/api/handlers.go`
  - `cmd/rag-eval/main.go`
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/embedding/*`

### Technical details

- Ticket: `RAGEVAL-004`.
- Primary guide: `design-doc/01-end-to-end-search-retrieval-implementation-guide.md`.
- Proposed new package: `internal/services/search`.
- Proposed new CLI group: `rag-eval search`.
- Proposed new endpoint group: `/api/v1/search/*`.
- Recommended implementation order: `BM25 -> manual real queries -> vector query search -> hybrid -> smoke query set -> benchmarks`.

---

## Step 2: reMarkable Upload and Ticket Completion

I uploaded the RAGEVAL-004 design package to reMarkable as a bundled PDF. The bundle includes the end-to-end search retrieval implementation guide and this implementation diary.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (see Step 1)

**Assistant interpretation:** Complete the ticket package delivery by publishing the retrieval design guide to reMarkable.

**Inferred user intent:** Make the retrieval implementation plan reviewable as a PDF before implementation begins.

### What I did

- Uploaded the design guide and diary with `remarquee upload bundle`.
- Used remote directory `/ai/2026/05/28/RAGEVAL-004`.
- Marked task 4 complete.
- Updated the changelog with the upload location.

### Why

The user requested that the guide be stored in the ticket and uploaded to reMarkable.

### What worked

- Upload succeeded:
  - `OK: uploaded RAGEVAL-004 Search Retrieval Foundation.pdf -> /ai/2026/05/28/RAGEVAL-004`

### What didn't work

- N/A.

### What I learned

- The retrieval implementation plan is now ready for review before code work starts.

### What was tricky to build

N/A for this upload step. I followed the minimal non-interactive reMarkable upload workflow without redundant status/list calls.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review the PDF before implementation, especially the BM25 technology choice and the staged boundary between smoke checks and formal benchmarks.

### What should be done in the future

- Start Phase 1 implementation: BM25 service, CLI, and real TTC query validation.

### Code review instructions

- Review the source markdown or uploaded PDF:
  - `design-doc/01-end-to-end-search-retrieval-implementation-guide.md`

### Technical details

- reMarkable path: `/ai/2026/05/28/RAGEVAL-004`.
- Uploaded bundle name: `RAGEVAL-004 Search Retrieval Foundation.pdf`.

---

## Step 3: Phase 1 BM25 Search Service and CLI

I implemented the first retrieval layer: a disposable Bleve/BM25 index built from canonical SQLite chunks and queried through a new `rag-eval search` CLI group. This gives the project its first end-to-end lexical retrieval path from persisted chunks to ranked chunk previews.

I also ran real TTC corpus queries against a bounded articles+guides index. The results showed that the plumbing works and that BM25 can find obvious exact-match material like `Crape Myrtle Varieties and Guide`; they also surfaced corpus coverage issues, such as `hydrangea pruning` returning weak results because the bounded indexed sample does not appear to contain focused hydrangea material.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** "Go ahead, task by task, commit at appropriate intervals, keep a diary as you go."

**Assistant interpretation:** Start implementing RAGEVAL-004 incrementally, commit focused milestones, and maintain the ticket diary/changelog while working.

**Inferred user intent:** Move from design into working retrieval functionality while keeping implementation progress reviewable and recoverable.

**Commit (code):** c24d8a5 — "feat: add BM25 search service and CLI"

### What I did

- Added Bleve dependency with:
  - `go get github.com/blevesearch/bleve/v2@latest`
- Added DB search helpers:
  - `internal/db/search_queries.go`
  - `ListChunksWithDocumentContext`
  - `UpsertSearchIndex`
  - `GetSearchIndex`
- Added BM25 search service:
  - `internal/services/search/service.go`
  - `internal/services/search/bm25.go`
  - `internal/services/search/service_test.go`
- Added Glazed/Cobra CLI command group:
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/root.go`
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/index.go`
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/query.go`
- Registered `search.NewCommand()` in `cmd/rag-eval/main.go`.
- Built a real BM25 index:
  - `bm25-ttc-guides-articles-fixed-1200-150`
  - sources: `ttc-dump-guides,ttc-dump-articles`
  - chunks indexed: `204`
  - documents indexed: `6`
- Ran real queries:
  - `crape myrtle varieties`
  - `how to plant arborvitae`
  - `hydrangea pruning`

### Why

BM25 is the cheapest and most explainable retrieval baseline. It proves that chunks can be indexed and retrieved before adding query embeddings, hybrid ranking, or benchmark machinery.

### What worked

- Unit tests passed:
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go test ./internal/services/search ./internal/db -count=1 -timeout 60s`
- CLI binary built:
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go build ./cmd/rag-eval`
- Real index build succeeded:
  - `chunk_count=204`
  - `document_count=6`
- `crape myrtle varieties` returned chunks from `ttc-article-6737` / `Crape Myrtle Varieties and Guide` as expected.
- `how to plant arborvitae` returned planting/privacy-screen guide material, which is plausible given the bounded sample.

### What didn't work

- `hydrangea pruning` returned weak results from Japanese maple and crape myrtle chunks. This appears to be a corpus/index coverage issue rather than a BM25 plumbing failure: the bounded indexed chunk set likely does not include a focused hydrangea pruning document.
- The implementation currently covers only BM25 service + CLI. HTTP endpoints, vector query search, hybrid search, and smoke query files are still open.

### What I learned

- The first real queries are already useful because they expose whether the indexed corpus subset contains the evidence needed for a query.
- The current TTC sample indexed for articles/guides is small: 204 chunks across 6 documents. This is enough for plumbing validation, but not enough to draw broad retrieval-quality conclusions.
- Exact-match article queries are a good first sanity check; broader care/product queries need richer source coverage and likely product text composition improvements.

### What was tricky to build

The main sharp edge was keeping the search index disposable while preserving enough metadata to query it later. The service now writes the Bleve index under `data/indexes/bm25/{index_id}` and records index metadata in `search_indexes`. Querying first consults SQLite metadata and falls back to the deterministic index-root path.

Another minor sharp edge was Bleve field extraction. Search results need stored fields for IDs, titles, source IDs, chunk indexes, and preview text. The first implementation indexes a small `indexedChunk` struct and requests those fields explicitly in the search request.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review whether the default Bleve mapping is sufficient or whether we should define explicit field mappings and analyzers before indexing larger corpora.
- Review index ID/path derivation and whether the CLI should require explicit `--index-id` for reproducibility.
- Review the BM25 query shape: current implementation uses a disjunction over `text` and boosted `title`; ranking can be tuned after more real query inspection.

### What should be done in the future

- Add BM25 HTTP endpoints for index build and query.
- Add query-vector search using existing Geppetto/Pinocchio provider resolution.
- Build broader indexes, including products, after deciding whether product `content_text` needs metadata composition improvements.
- Create a small retrieval smoke query file after BM25 and vector search both exist.

### Code review instructions

- Start with:
  - `internal/services/search/bm25.go`
  - `internal/services/search/service.go`
  - `internal/db/search_queries.go`
- Then inspect CLI wiring:
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/index.go`
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/query.go`
  - `cmd/rag-eval/main.go`
- Validate with:
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go test ./internal/services/search ./internal/db -count=1 -timeout 60s`
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go build ./cmd/rag-eval`
  - `./rag-eval search index --strategy-id fixed-1200-150 --source-ids ttc-dump-guides,ttc-dump-articles --index-id bm25-ttc-guides-articles-fixed-1200-150 --force --output table`
  - `./rag-eval search query --index-id bm25-ttc-guides-articles-fixed-1200-150 --query "crape myrtle varieties" --limit 5 --output table`

### Technical details

- BM25 index path used during validation:
  - `data/indexes/bm25/bm25-ttc-guides-articles-fixed-1200-150`
- The derived index is intentionally under ignored `data/` and should not be committed.
- Current result rows include rank, retriever, index ID, query, score, chunk ID, document ID, source ID, title, chunk index, URL, and preview.

---

## Step 4: BM25 HTTP Search Endpoints

I added HTTP adapters for the BM25 retrieval service. The API now exposes one endpoint for building a BM25 index and one endpoint for running lexical search queries, both backed by the same `internal/services/search` service used by the CLI.

This keeps the project invariant intact: CLI and HTTP are adapters over shared services. The next frontend search surface can call `/api/v1/search/query` without duplicating retrieval logic.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (see Step 3)

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue RAGEVAL-004 task-by-task and commit each coherent implementation slice.

**Inferred user intent:** Build the retrieval foundation in small validated pieces while keeping CLI/API parity.

**Commit (code):** 314f4ed — "feat: add BM25 search HTTP endpoints"

### What I did

- Added routes in `internal/api/handlers.go`:
  - `POST /api/v1/search/indexes`
  - `POST /api/v1/search/query`
- Added handler methods:
  - `handleSearchBuildIndex`
  - `handleSearchQuery`
- Both handlers instantiate `searchservice.NewService(h.queries, req.IndexRoot)` and call the shared BM25 service.
- Ran API validation by starting `./rag-eval serve --address 127.0.0.1:18080` and querying:
  - `POST /api/v1/search/query`
  - query: `crape myrtle varieties`
  - result count: `3`
  - top result: `Crape Myrtle Varieties and Guide`, chunk `chk-d7da1954af40483f`.

### Why

Search must be available to both CLI workflows and the web app. Adding HTTP endpoints after the CLI/service slice proves that the same retrieval behavior is reusable from API clients.

### What worked

- Targeted tests/build passed:
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go test ./internal/services/search ./internal/db ./internal/api -count=1 -timeout 60s`
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go build ./cmd/rag-eval`
- HTTP smoke query returned the same plausible Crape Myrtle result as the CLI query path.

### What didn't work

- No HTTP-specific tests were added yet; validation was manual with `curl`.
- Only BM25 endpoints exist. Vector and hybrid HTTP endpoints remain future tasks.

### What I learned

- The search service boundary is clean enough for both CLI and HTTP adapters.
- The existing `internal/api/handlers.go` route structure remains manageable for this slice, though future search/vector/hybrid endpoints may warrant splitting handlers into files.

### What was tricky to build

The API needs to pass an optional `index_root` for testability and non-default deployments, but typical users should not need it. The handler keeps it optional and lets the service default to `data/indexes`.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review whether index building should be exposed as a POST endpoint immediately, or whether write-like operations should be gated before the public UI uses them.
- Review whether `index_root` should be accepted over HTTP or only configured server-side.

### What should be done in the future

- Add vector query HTTP endpoint after vector service exists.
- Add hybrid HTTP endpoint after hybrid service exists.
- Add frontend search UI only after the CLI/API retrieval behavior is validated with more real queries.

### Code review instructions

- Review `internal/api/handlers.go`, especially route registration and `handleSearchBuildIndex` / `handleSearchQuery`.
- Validate with:
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go test ./internal/services/search ./internal/db ./internal/api -count=1 -timeout 60s`
  - start server and POST to `/api/v1/search/query`.

### Technical details

Example smoke request:

```json
{
  "index_id": "bm25-ttc-guides-articles-fixed-1200-150",
  "query": "crape myrtle varieties",
  "limit": 3,
  "preview_runes": 100
}
```

---

## Step 5: Query-Vector Search over Stored Embeddings

I implemented query-vector retrieval: the system can now embed a user query through the existing Geppetto/Pinocchio provider resolver, load stored chunk embeddings from SQLite, compute cosine similarity, and return ranked chunk evidence with source/document context.

This is the second standalone retrieval path. BM25 can now be tested independently from vector retrieval, which is required before implementing hybrid search.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (see Step 3)

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue implementing RAGEVAL-004 in small tested slices.

**Inferred user intent:** Add the next retrieval building block while keeping provider calls explicit and bounded.

**Commit (code):** 952b4ab — "feat: add vector query search"

### What I did

- Added source-filtered embedding context query:
  - `ListChunkEmbeddingsForStrategySourcesWithContext`
  - `ChunkEmbeddingWithContext`
- Added vector retrieval service:
  - `internal/services/search/vector.go`
- Added unit tests with a fake embedding provider:
  - query vector ranks closest stored vector first;
  - source filters restrict candidate embeddings.
- Added CLI command:
  - `rag-eval search vector`
- Added HTTP endpoint:
  - `POST /api/v1/search/vector`
- Reused existing provider resolution from `internal/services/embedding/provider.go`.
- Ran a live OpenAI profile smoke query over existing embedded TTC chunks:
  - query: `which trees make a good privacy screen`
  - top result: `Leyland Cypress` product chunk;
  - additional result: `Crape Myrtle Varieties and Guide` screening-related chunk.

### Why

Chunk-to-chunk similarity was already implemented, but real RAG search needs user-query-to-chunk retrieval. Vector query search validates provider resolution, query embedding, stored vector decoding, cosine scoring, source filtering, and result rendering as one bounded path.

### What worked

- Tests/build passed:
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go test ./internal/services/search ./internal/db ./internal/api -count=1 -timeout 60s`
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go build ./cmd/rag-eval`
- Live OpenAI smoke succeeded:
  - `./rag-eval search vector --query "which trees make a good privacy screen" --strategy-id fixed-1200-150 --source-ids ttc-dump-articles,ttc-dump-guides,ttc-dump-products,thetreecenter-guides --profile openai-embedding-small --profile-registries ~/.config/pinocchio/profiles.yaml --limit 5 --candidate-limit 80 --preview-runes 140 --output table`
- Results were plausible: Leyland Cypress screening/product chunks ranked at the top.

### What didn't work

- Vector search only searches chunks that already have stored embeddings. Current coverage is intentionally sparse, so results are useful as plumbing validation but not full corpus retrieval quality.
- HTTP vector endpoint was not live-smoked to avoid extra provider calls; service/CLI path and API build validation passed.

### What I learned

- The existing OpenAI-embedded product sample is already useful for semantic product discovery queries.
- Source-balanced embedding coverage is important: vector retrieval cannot find documents that are not embedded.
- Candidate limits must remain explicit because the first implementation scans SQLite-stored embeddings rather than a native vector index.

### What was tricky to build

The vector path needs richer metadata than `chunk_embeddings` alone provides. I added a DB helper that joins embeddings to chunks and documents so vector results can include `source_id`, title, URL, chunk index, and preview text without extra per-result lookups.

The API/CLI also need to expose provider configuration without running live calls in tests. Unit tests use a fake provider; live provider calls remain explicit smoke commands.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review whether HTTP should accept full provider credentials/options or whether vector search should require named profiles only.
- Review whether `candidate_limit` should default to 500 or lower while coverage is sparse.
- Review whether vector result previews should use stored chunk text directly or a shared preview helper with the Corpus Explorer.

### What should be done in the future

- Implement hybrid retrieval by merging BM25 and vector results.
- Add a smoke query file to compare BM25/vector/hybrid behavior.
- Consider a native vector index only after full-corpus embedding scale demands it.

### Code review instructions

- Start with:
  - `internal/services/search/vector.go`
  - `internal/db/search_queries.go`
  - `internal/services/search/service_test.go`
- Then inspect adapters:
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/vector.go`
  - `internal/api/handlers.go`
- Validate with fake-provider tests, then optionally a live smoke query using `openai-embedding-small`.

### Technical details

The live smoke command used bounded parameters:

```bash
GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB ./rag-eval search vector \
  --query "which trees make a good privacy screen" \
  --strategy-id fixed-1200-150 \
  --source-ids ttc-dump-articles,ttc-dump-guides,ttc-dump-products,thetreecenter-guides \
  --profile openai-embedding-small \
  --profile-registries ~/.config/pinocchio/profiles.yaml \
  --limit 5 \
  --candidate-limit 80 \
  --preview-runes 140 \
  --output table
```

---

## Step 6: Hybrid Retrieval and BM25 Smoke Query Runner

I implemented the first hybrid retriever and a lightweight smoke-query runner. Hybrid retrieval now runs BM25 and vector search independently, then merges their ranked lists with reciprocal-rank fusion. The smoke runner executes a small YAML query suite against BM25 and reports pass/warn/fail rows based on simple expected-term/source checks.

This completes the first end-to-end retrieval foundation: lexical search, vector search, hybrid search, API adapters, and a non-benchmark smoke loop that catches broken plumbing.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (see Step 3)

**Assistant interpretation:** Continue the RAGEVAL-004 implementation plan through hybrid retrieval and smoke checks.

**Inferred user intent:** Make the system ready for real retrieval validation before formal benchmark design.

**Commit (code):** 5fd061a — "feat: add hybrid retrieval and smoke checks"

### What I did

- Added hybrid service:
  - `internal/services/search/hybrid.go`
  - `HybridQueryRequest`
  - `QueryHybrid`
  - reciprocal-rank fusion with `DefaultRRFK = 60`
- Extended retrieval results with component evidence:
  - `components.bm25.rank/score`
  - `components.vector.rank/score`
- Added hybrid unit test that verifies BM25/vector duplicate evidence is merged.
- Added CLI command:
  - `rag-eval search hybrid`
- Added HTTP endpoint:
  - `POST /api/v1/search/hybrid`
- Added smoke query runner:
  - `rag-eval search smoke`
- Added seed smoke file:
  - `eval/ttc-smoke.yaml`
- Ran live hybrid smoke query with OpenAI query embedding and existing stored vectors.
- Ran BM25 smoke suite against `bm25-ttc-guides-articles-fixed-1200-150`.

### Why

Hybrid search should not be a black box. It needs visible component evidence so a developer can tell whether a result came from BM25, vector search, or both. The smoke runner gives us a lightweight way to detect broken retrieval before designing formal benchmark metrics.

### What worked

- Tests/build passed:
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go test ./internal/services/search ./internal/db ./internal/api -count=1 -timeout 60s`
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go build ./cmd/rag-eval`
- Hybrid live smoke query for `which trees make a good privacy screen` returned a useful mix:
  - vector result: `Leyland Cypress` product chunks;
  - BM25 result: `How To Plant a Privacy Screen` guide chunks.
- BM25 smoke suite produced meaningful statuses:
  - `crape-myrtle-varieties`: pass;
  - `arborvitae-planting`: pass, but top result was Japanese maples because only `plant` matched strongly;
  - `emerald-green-spacing`: pass with Thuja Green Giant material;
  - `hydrangea-pruning`: warn because expected terms were absent from top results;
  - `privacy-screen-trees`: pass.

### What didn't work

- The smoke runner currently supports BM25 only. It intentionally remains lightweight and should not become a benchmark framework yet.
- Hybrid RRF can produce equal scores when a result appears as rank 1 in one retriever only. This is expected for simple RRF and can be tuned later if needed.
- Hydrangea query weakness remains a corpus coverage/indexing issue in the bounded sample.

### What I learned

- Hybrid retrieval already demonstrates complementary behavior: vector search finds embedded product chunks, while BM25 finds exact guide text.
- Smoke checks are valuable even when imperfect because they flag queries that need either broader corpus coverage or improved text composition.
- The next benchmark design should build on these smoke observations rather than start from abstract metrics.

### What was tricky to build

The main design edge was preserving explainability in hybrid output. I added per-retriever components directly to `RetrievalResult` so JSON consumers can see component ranks/scores, while the CLI prints `bm25_rank`, `bm25_score`, `vector_rank`, and `vector_score` as table columns.

The smoke runner needed to stay intentionally simple. It checks for any expected term and expected source in top-K results. That makes it a plumbing check, not a relevance judgment.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review the RRF implementation and whether `k=60` is appropriate for early testing.
- Review whether the smoke pass criteria are too permissive, especially for `arborvitae-planting` where only `plant` matched.
- Review whether HTTP hybrid should allow provider credentials/options directly or should only allow named profiles.

### What should be done in the future

- Run broader BM25 indexes, especially including products, after product text composition is reviewed.
- Add vector/hybrid modes to the smoke runner once we want smoke comparisons across retrievers.
- Start RAGEVAL-005 or a follow-up benchmark ticket only after enough real queries have been inspected.

### Code review instructions

- Start with:
  - `internal/services/search/hybrid.go`
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/hybrid.go`
  - `cmd/rag-eval/cmds/search/smoke.go`
  - `eval/ttc-smoke.yaml`
- Validate with:
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go test ./internal/services/search ./internal/db ./internal/api -count=1 -timeout 60s`
  - `GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go build ./cmd/rag-eval`
  - `./rag-eval search smoke --file eval/ttc-smoke.yaml --index-id bm25-ttc-guides-articles-fixed-1200-150 --limit 5 --output table`

### Technical details

Hybrid smoke command used:

```bash
GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB ./rag-eval search hybrid \
  --query "which trees make a good privacy screen" \
  --index-id bm25-ttc-guides-articles-fixed-1200-150 \
  --strategy-id fixed-1200-150 \
  --source-ids ttc-dump-articles,ttc-dump-guides,ttc-dump-products,thetreecenter-guides \
  --profile openai-embedding-small \
  --profile-registries ~/.config/pinocchio/profiles.yaml \
  --limit 5 \
  --bm25-limit 20 \
  --vector-limit 20 \
  --candidate-limit 80 \
  --preview-runes 120 \
  --output table
```

## Step 7: Final Validation for Retrieval Foundation Slice

I ran the broader internal test/build validation after the BM25, vector, hybrid, and smoke-query slices were committed. The retrieval foundation now has tested service code, CLI commands, HTTP handlers, and real TTC smoke output.

This does not mean retrieval quality is solved. It means the base retrieval machinery is now working end to end and is ready for iterative corpus/query inspection before formal benchmark design.

### Prompt Context

**User prompt (verbatim):** (see Step 3)

**Assistant interpretation:** Validate the completed task sequence and leave a clear continuation point.

**Inferred user intent:** Ensure the implementation is stable enough to continue with real search experiments.

### What I did

- Ran broader internal package tests.
- Rebuilt the CLI binary.
- Ran `docmgr doctor` for RAGEVAL-004.
- Confirmed only unrelated pre-existing working-tree files remain unstaged.

### Why

The retrieval path touches DB helpers, services, CLI commands, HTTP handlers, and provider-backed vector behavior. A broader validation pass reduces the chance that one slice broke another.

### What worked

Validation passed:

```bash
GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go test ./internal/db ./internal/ingest ./internal/chunking ./internal/services/source ./internal/services/chunking ./internal/services/document ./internal/services/embedding ./internal/services/corpus ./internal/services/search ./internal/api -count=1 -timeout 60s
GOMAXPROCS=2 GOMEMLIMIT=1024MiB go build ./cmd/rag-eval
docmgr doctor --ticket RAGEVAL-004 --stale-after 30
```

### What didn't work

- N/A for validation. Known retrieval caveats remain documented in earlier steps.

### What I learned

- The implementation is stable enough to run more real TTC query experiments.
- The next useful work is not more infrastructure; it is inspecting retrieval results, broadening indexes/embeddings where needed, and fixing corpus text composition problems exposed by queries.

### What was tricky to build

N/A for this validation step.

### What warrants a second pair of eyes

- Review the retrieval outputs from the real smoke queries, especially permissive smoke passes where only one expected term matched.
- Review product text composition before using product search behavior as benchmark evidence.

### What should be done in the future

- Build a product-inclusive BM25 index and run the same smoke queries.
- Compute more source-balanced embeddings before judging vector search quality.
- Promote smoke query observations into benchmark candidates only after manual review.

### Code review instructions

- Review commits:
  - `c24d8a5` BM25 search service and CLI
  - `314f4ed` BM25 HTTP endpoints
  - `952b4ab` vector query search
  - `5fd061a` hybrid retrieval and smoke checks

### Technical details

Current uncommitted working-tree items are unrelated pre-existing frontend build/screenshot artifacts and were intentionally left untouched.
